# Roadmap: wiimms-szs-tools-plus

> This is an engineering log, not user documentation. Start with
> [README.md](README.md) for the format index and
> [docs/WORKFLOWS.md](docs/WORKFLOWS.md) for the unpack/edit/selective-rebuild
> workflow. The detail below is retained as implementation provenance.

Working plan for the next round of fork work. Items are grouped by how ready
they are to build, not by the order they were requested in. Update this file
as items land — move them to the README's format table / gist and delete the
row here once shipped, matching the "don't let docs drift" norm this project
already follows.

## 0. Baseline check: `wszst XX` on a real WBFS today

Ran `wszst XX "Kirby's Epic Yarn (USA).wbfs"` (4.0 GB, no prior unpacking)
against the current build, no flags beyond `--dest`.

- `wit` pass-through unpacked the WBFS's UPDATE and DATA partitions.
- `.arc`/U8 archives and IOS `.wad` (via `sharpii` pass-through,
  recursively, including the `.app` content-file fix from an earlier
  session) got extracted.
- End-to-end output: 3.9 GB extracted from Kirby's Epic Yarn's DATA/UPDATE
  partitions, no crashes.
- **One real gap found**: two `stage*/section001.bgst3` files (101–108 MiB)
  hit the default `--max-file-size=100m` security limit — since fixed by
  raising the default to 512 MiB (§2).
- **Two real bugs found the first pass here missed** (an early skim of this
  same log claimed ".gfa got extracted" — it hadn't; the raw `.gfa` files
  were just sitting there uninspected, copied by `wit` but never actually
  decoded). Both are fixed now, verified against this exact WBFS:
  1. `DecodeBPE()`'s pair-table parser (ported from QuickBMS's `bpe.c`,
     itself from Philip Gage's 1994 *C Users Journal* `compress.c`) had
     never been checked against real data, only a synthetic round-trip —
     it silently desynced on every one of the 2342 real `.gfa` archives on
     this disc (0 decoded). The actual encoder logic (recovered from
     `bpe.c`'s `filewrite()`) has a non-obvious quirk: after a
     literal-run marker byte, the very next table entry is written with
     *no marker of its own* — my prior decoder treated every marker
     independently and desynced on the first table it ever saw for real.
  2. Separately, `extract_sarc_file`/`extract_pac_file`/`extract_gfa_file`
     all called `SubstDest(...,opt_dest,"\1P/\1N",...)` for their
     destination — but `SubstDest()` with a NULL `opt_dest` (exactly the
     case when `extract_tree()` recurses into pass-through-staged files)
     just echoes the source path back unchanged, so the "destination"
     came out identical to the source file itself → every write inside it
     failed with "Not a directory". This affected SARC and PAC too, not
     just GFA, and only shows up once something is reached *through*
     pass-through recursion rather than passed directly on the command
     line — exactly the "wszst xx should slice open anything" case this
     goal is about. Fixed with a shared `beside_source_dest()` helper.
  3. A third, smaller bug in the same decoder: the pair-expansion stack
     was sized `u8[128]`, but a real sample (`z100_tutorial01.gfa`) needs
     depth 139. Since pair codes only chain downward across 256 possible
     byte values, `u8[256]` is the correct worst-case bound.
  - Result after all three fixes: **2342/2342** `.gfa` archives on this
    disc now decode (was 0/2342). New `tests/regress.sh` GFA case added,
    asserting real non-empty decoded members, not just "a file exists."
  4. **Found in a later session**: extracting a `.gfa` correctly produced
     its `.brres` member, but nothing further happened to it — the
     `.brres`'s own `3DModels(NW4R)` MDL0 files were written to disk but
     never converted to DAE, because `extract_sarc_file`/
     `extract_pac_file`/`extract_gfa_file` never recursed into their own
     output directory (pass-through staging already did this via
     `extract_tree()`; these three didn't), and separately `wszst XX`
     never called the model→DAE exporter at all for anything it
     extracted (only the standalone `wmdlt` tool did). Both fixed: the
     three extractors now call `extract_tree()` on their own output once
     writing succeeds, and a new `export_model_if_possible()` +
     `export_models_tree()` walk in `wszst.c` calls `ParseMDL0()` /
     `ExportModelToDAE()` on every model file found once `export_count>0`
     (i.e. `XX`, which aliases to `XEXPORT`). Verified end-to-end on a
     real `.gfa` from this same disc (`oscilloscope_01.gfa`): its
     `n.brres` → `3DModels(NW4R)/n_01_000.dae` now comes out as valid,
     non-trivial COLLADA XML (real `<geometry>`/`<node>` elements), where
     before the pipeline silently stopped one level too early.

So several asks below are **already done** (see the checklist), and the
rest builds on a pass-through architecture now proven against a real,
large, real-world disc image *and* verified all the way down to individual
archive contents, not just "the top-level command didn't crash."

## 1. Already done (confirm, don't re-implement)

- ✅ **Drop the LAYERS command** — removed last session (`b7af627`).
- ✅ **`.u8` creation → `.arc`** — `FF_U8`'s registered extension in
  `file-type.c` has always been `.arc` (confirmed by re-reading
  `file-type.c:156`); the only stale place was a doc string in `ui.def`,
  already fixed.
- 🟡 **wit/ndstool/sharpii pass-through** — implemented and proven above.
  `ctrtool` and `hactool` are both wired but **untested** (neither tool
  is installed on this machine) — see §3.

## 2. Small, mechanical

- ✅ **Drop the RSA-consumer build guard.** Removed `check-rsa-consumers`
  from the Makefile and the matching restriction comment from
  `lib-rsa.h`; `lib-rsa.c` is now a normal internal API any object file can
  call (needed if BFSAR/BCSAR or other future formats turn out to need
  signature verification — see §5).
- ✅ **Raise the default `--max-file-size`.** Bumped 100 MiB → 512 MiB
  (`opt_max_file_size` in `lib-std.c`, help text in `tab-wszst.inc`) so the
  Kirby's Epic Yarn `.bgst3` case from §0 (101-108 MiB) extracts without a
  manual flag. Still a bounded security default, not unlimited — full
  streaming instead of `LoadFileAlloc` would be the "no limit at all"
  version of this fix but is materially more work for a case this rare.

## 3. Pass-through coverage: fill the gaps

Extend the existing `lib-passthru.c` mechanism (`wit`/`ndstool`/`ctrtool`/
`sharpii`, each optional and independently path-overridable) rather than
rearchitecting it — it already recurses into staged output correctly.

- 🟡 **`hactool` for Switch** (NSP/XCI/NCA) — wired in `lib-passthru.c`,
  same shape as the existing four: NSP/XCI claimed by their real plaintext
  header signatures (PFS0 / "HEAD" at 0x100), NCA by extension only (its
  payload is encrypted, no reliable plaintext magic to key off). NSP/XCI
  unpack to member NCAs; this fork's own `extract_tree()` recursion then
  re-submits those and hactool unpacks them as `--type=nca`. **Unverified**
  — no hactool binary or real Switch sample was available on this machine
  to test against, unlike wit/ndstool/sharpii (see §0); flags are per
  hactool's own `--help` text, not confirmed against real output. Needs
  the same real-sample verification pass before calling it "done."
- **Verify `ctrtool`** against a real `.cia`/`.3ds` once one is available
  (or install `ctrtool` and use a sample from the disc corpus already on
  disk) — currently unverified, not "done."
- ✅ **BLZ from CUE's Nintendo DS Decompressor — native, plus ARM9/ARM7/
  overlay wiring.** Done and verified this session. Ported `DecodeBLZ()`
  into `lib-nintendo.c` from the actual reference source
  (github.com/PeterLemon/Nintendo_DS_Compressors' `blz.c`, CUE's own tool —
  fetched and read, not reconstructed from memory) after search results
  alone weren't precise enough to trust: "backward LZSS", a trailing
  8-11 byte footer (`inc_len`/`hdr_len`/`enc_len`) instead of a header, the
  compressed span physically byte-reversed before an ordinary forward LZSS
  walk (min match 3, 12-bit back-reference), then un-reversed. Verified
  **byte-exact against the real `blz` reference binary** (built from that
  same source and run for real) across three cases: a synthetic repetitive
  sample, a larger 32000-byte sample, and the "not coded" fallback path —
  which turned out to have a real, non-obvious quirk only caught by
  actually running the reference decoder: a "not coded" file decodes to
  the *entire original .blz file unchanged, footer included*, not the
  footer-stripped plain content an on-paper reading of the encoder suggests.
  Wired into the `ndstool` pass-through (`lib-passthru.c`): `arm9.bin`/
  `arm7.bin`/every file in `overlay/` are now decompressed in place if they
  decode as valid BLZ, left untouched otherwise — `DecodeBLZ()`'s own
  strict structural validation (footer sanity range checks, LZSS walk must
  exactly consume the compressed span and land on the expected output size)
  is the only gate, so a non-BLZ executable can't get corrupted by a
  false-positive footer match. Also reachable directly: `wszst DECOMPRESS
  x.blz` — dispatched by the `.blz` source *extension*, not the usual
  header-magic table, since BLZ has no magic to detect by (any file could
  coincidentally have a plausible-looking footer).
  **Real-ROM check**: ran end-to-end against 3 real retail `.nds` ROMs
  (`Tetris Party Live`, `Bomberman Blitz`, `Animal Crossing Calculator`) —
  none of their `arm9.bin` turned out to actually be BLZ-compressed
  (`hdr_len` byte was `2` in all three, outside BLZ's valid `8..11` range),
  so the validator correctly left all three untouched rather than
  guessing. That's a genuine real-world negative-case check, not a
  positive one — no retail sample on this machine happened to ship a
  BLZ-compressed ARM9/overlay to exercise the in-place-rewrite path
  end-to-end; the byte-exact reference-tool round trip is what backs
  correctness, this is what backs "doesn't corrupt files it shouldn't
  touch." Flagging that gap explicitly rather than overclaiming it.
- ✅ **Nintendo Huffman (0x24 / 0x28)** — done. `DecodeNintendoHuff()` in
  `lib-nintendo.c` (and wired to `wszst DECOMPRESS` and `wbmsx COMTYPE huff4`/`huff8`)
  decompresses both 4-bit nibble Huffman streams (0x24) and 8-bit byte Huffman
  streams (0x28) with support for standard 24-bit headers and 32-bit extended
  headers.
  **Real bug fixed**: child tree node offset calculation had a tree base
  alignment bug `((node+tree_base) & ~1u) - tree_base` which miscalculated
  child offsets whenever `tree_base` was odd (the standard case). Corrected to
  `(node & ~1u) + 2 + 2*(entry & 0x3f) + bit`.
  Verified byte-exact across `wszst DECOMPRESS` and `wbmsx` for both 4-bit and
  8-bit streams (`tests/regress.sh`'s `t_huffman`).

## 4. QuickBMS coverage + native fallback

- ✅ **ZLIB** in `wbmsx`'s `COMTYPE` set — done. The interpreter already
  linked `-lz` for libpng (and `wmpbdump`/`wmpbpack` already used
  `<zlib.h>` directly), so this reuses the existing system zlib rather than
  vendoring anything. Added `decode_zlib_comtype()` in `lib-bms.c`, wired
  to both `COMTYPE zlib` (2-byte zlib header, `windowBits=15`) and
  `COMTYPE deflate` (raw, `windowBits=-15` — same call, same amount of
  code, so aliased rather than skipped). `CLOG`'s optional 4th operand
  (uncompressed-size hint) is honored as a starting buffer size but not
  trusted blindly — if the real output doesn't fit, it grows and
  decompresses again from scratch rather than truncating. Verified against
  three cases via a real `wbmsx` run, not just unit-level: hinted size,
  no hint at all (exercises the grow path), and raw deflate — all
  byte-exact round trips. `tests/regress.sh`'s `t_wbmsx_zlib` covers
  zlib+deflate going forward (uses `python3`'s `zlib` module to generate
  the compressed fixture, since there's no portable pure-shell way to
  produce one — the only test in this file that does).
- ✅ **`COMTYPE` aliases for this fork's own native decoders** — done.
  `ash0`/`rl`/`rle`/`huff4`/`huff8`/`huffman`/`rnc`/`rnc1`/`rnc2`/`lzh8`/
  `quicklz`/`qlz`/`blz`/`camelot`/`stpl` all now dispatch to the decoders
  this fork already ships for those formats (`DecodeASH0`,
  `DecodeNintendoRL`, `DecodeNintendoHuff`, `DecodeRNC`, `DecodeLZH8`,
  `DecodeQuickLZ`, `DecodeBLZ`, `DecodeCamelot`) instead of falling
  through to magic-sniffing/raw-copy. These are this fork's own alias
  names, not stock QuickBMS plugin names — quickbms itself has no
  Nintendo-specific plugin for most of these, so a real QuickBMS script
  for one of these games wouldn't necessarily say `COMTYPE ash0` etc.;
  this is aimed at *this project's own* BMS scripts naming things by the
  same convention the rest of the codebase already uses. `ash0`/`rl`/
  `lzh8`/`quicklz` verified end-to-end via `tests/regress.sh`'s
  `t_wbmsx_native` (round-trips real `wszst COMPRESS` output through
  `wbmsx`'s `COMTYPE`); `huffman`/`rnc`/`blz`/`camelot` have no encoder in
  this codebase to generate a round-trip fixture from, so they're wired
  but not covered by an automated test yet.
- ✅ **`COMTYPE`-scan pass vs. the real retail corpus — done, verdict: no
  new ports warranted.** Classified the plausible missing QuickBMS
  `COMTYPE`s that Nintendo-relevant data could ever use here but that this
  fork's dispatch (`lib-bms.c`'s `strcasecmp (ctx->comtype, ...)` chain)
  doesn't yet recognize: `lzma`, `lz4`/`lz4f`, `bzip2`/`bzip2r`, `lzo1x`
  (all four decoders are already linked into `wbmsx` — `lib-lzma.o`,
  `lib-lz4.o`, the `libbz2/*.o` set, and `lib-lzovl.o` — so any of them
  could be aliased in minutes). Then tested reachability directly at the
  byte level against the real on-disk Wii U retail corpus: scanned all
  29,238 files under the extracted
  `Yoshi's Woolly World (USA) (En,Fr,Es).d/content` tree (plus the
  `code/pj023.rpx` and the `.wux`/`.key` dumps) for the LZ4 frame magic
  `04 22 4D 18`, `BZh`, the `.lzma` 0x5D-prop/dictionary header, and the
  LZO1X 0x11-opcode heuristic — **zero hits**. YWW (a representative SDK
  Wii U title) ships its assets as SZS/Yaz0 and raw SDK formats already
  covered; nothing on this corpus reaches a QuickBMS-only codec. Keep the
  `wbmsx` dispatch as-is; if a later corpus does surface LZ4/LZMA/bzip2/
  LZO streams, they wire as one-line aliases to the already-linked native
  decoders (`DecodeLZ4` frame / the `lib-lzma` buffer decoder / the
  `libbz2` buffered API / `DecodeLZO1XGrow`), following the same pattern
  this section's `zlib`/`ash0`/`rl`/`huff`/`rnc`/`lzh8`/`qlz`/`blz`/
  `camelot` aliases already proved.
- ✅ **Auto-fallback to native comtype during extraction — done.** The
  ordinary `XX` recursion already does this (committed, pre-existing this
  session): `extract_one_file_inner()` (`wszst_cmd/formats.inc`)
  calls `decompress_nintendo_file3()` on every plain (non-BRSUB/PLT0/
  PNG/text, non-archive) member it lands on. That single dispatch covers
  BLZ (`.blz` extension), zlib/deflate (`IsZlib` sniff or `.zlib`/
  `.deflate` extension), zstd, LZ4, wav, wux, and every
  `DetectNintendoFormat` header type (LZ10/LZ11, MVDK, HUFF4/8, RL, ASH0,
  YAY0, LZH8, QuickLZ, STPL/Camelot, RNC, ROMC, AT7, FZIP, VLX) —
  i.e. exactly the "native comtype" set. On success it recurses once on
  the decompressed destination (terminates: the payload can't start with
  the same codec's magic again), and deletes the decompressed intermediate
  unless it's a finished deliverable (`.bfwav`→WAV) or `--export-raw` was
  given, so stray raw dumps can't be swept back in by a later `CREATE`.
  `wszst XX --auto` additionally sweeps whole output trees after
  extraction (`auto_decompress_tree()` in `create_update.inc`, gated on
  the extract command's own `--auto` option — distinct from the minimap
  option that shares the `OPT_AUTO` enum in other commands) for
  compressed streams nested deeper than one file at a time. Every
  QuickBMS-COMTYPE named in this section is already inside
  `decompress_nintendo_file3`'s reach, so no further wiring was needed.
  **Evidence**: the machinery is committed and was built into the last
  `bin/wszst`; a fresh end-to-end `XX` re-run is deferred to the first
  build after the sibling `ui-wszst`/`main.inc` change lands (the current
  tree cannot relink `wszst` until then — the same blocker noted in the
  G1T section), while the individual decoders keep their existing
  `tests/regress.sh` coverage.

## 5. New container/font formats (research needed before implementing)

- 🟡 **BRFNT (Wii bitmap font)** — done and verified this session, the
  rest of the family isn't. Real spec pulled from
  [hadashisora/NintyFont](https://github.com/hadashisora/NintyFont) (a
  working, GPLv3, from-source font editor — read its actual `RFNT`/`NFTR`/
  `FINF`/`TGLP`/`CWDH`/`CMAP` C++ classes, not reconstructed from a wiki
  summary that turned out to be 403-blocked anyway) after confirming the
  general shape via search first. Wired into `AssignIMG()`
  (`lib-image2.c`): scans NFTR-family sections for `TGLP` (real fonts vary
  in section order/count, so this isn't a fixed-offset read), decodes the
  glyph sheet through this codebase's *existing* GX texture geometry table
  (`GetImageGeometry()` — the same one PLT0/TEX0 already use, since
  BRFNT's sheet formats are the identical GX `I4`/`I8`/`IA4`/.../`RGBA8`
  enum), so no new pixel-decode code was needed at all, only the container
  parse. `wimgt DECODE x.brfnt` works today.
  Verified **visually on 3 diverse real retail samples**, not just "a file
  got created": `wanpaku_30_I4.brfnt` (Big Brain Academy, ASCII, I4) and
  `suetake_edge_30_IA4.brfnt` (same game, IA4 outline glyphs) both render
  crisp, correctly-shaped Latin characters; `fot_happiness.brfnt` (My
  Pokémon Ranch, I4) renders real kana/katakana. One real bug found only
  by testing a large multi-sheet sample
  (`wbf1.brfna`, Wii system menu CJK font, 70 sheets): `sheetFormat`'s
  low byte is the real GX format id, but this file has a high flag bit set
  (`0x8000`, meaning undocumented anywhere checked) that a naive full-u16
  read turns into garbage — masking to the low byte is what makes the
  declared `sheetSize` match `xwidth*xheight*bpp/8` exactly for the masked
  format, confirming it's the right fix and not a guess. Curated real
  sample + `tests/regress.sh`'s `t_brfnt` added.
- ✅ **BRFNA (font *archive*, "RFNA")** — fully done and verified this
  session, including real pixel decode (not just container extraction).
  Static RE of `nw4r_fontcvtr.exe` (no written spec exists anywhere in the
  SDK; see the `brfna_archived_font_format` memory) confirmed BRFNA is
  BRFNT's container/TGLP shape, tagged `RFNA` instead of `RFNT` when the
  source carries an optional `GLGR` (glyph-group) block, with `CGLP` as a
  same-shaped alternate to `TGLP`.
  **The real story**: every real `.brfna` sample sets TGLP `sheetFormat`'s
  bit `0x8000` — this isn't a stray flag or a tiling quirk, it means the
  sheet's pixel data is **compressed** with a proprietary, wholly
  undocumented codec, not raw GX texture data at all. That's also why
  declared sheet counts looked like they overflowed the file (`wbf1.brfna`
  declares 70 sheets, an earlier pass could only fit ~27 assuming raw
  uncompressed data) — they don't overflow anything; each sheet is a
  separately-sized compressed chunk, and 70 really are present once you
  decompress them.
  Cracked the codec by decompiling the real decoder functions out of
  `nw4r_fontcvtr.exe` via Ghidra (a local `ghidrassistmcp` instance,
  reachable only over raw HTTP/MCP-streamable-transport on port 8080, not
  the `mcp__ghidra__*` tool family — see the memory for the exact client
  recipe) and cross-checking against ground truth obtained by round-
  tripping real files through the actual Nintendo tool under Wine. Three
  opcodes, selected by a nibble in each per-sheet token's first byte:
  classic byte-oriented LZSS (length/distance back-references into the
  growing output), a simple RLE (literal-run / repeat-run control bytes),
  and a self-contained canonical-Huffman-style bit-walk whose code tree is
  embedded directly in the token's own bytes rather than transmitted
  separately. A fourth opcode (a delta/predictive table encoder) was
  decompiled but never observed on real pixel-sheet data, so it's left
  unimplemented (fails cleanly rather than guessing).
  Implemented natively in `lib-image2.c`
  (`DecodeBRFNA_LZSS`/`DecodeBRFNA_RLE`/`DecodeBRFNA_Huffman`/
  `DecompressBRFNASheet`), wired into `AssignIMG`'s TGLP branch so the
  compressed case decompresses each sheet into a fresh buffer before the
  existing (already-correct) GX-tiled pixel decode runs on it. **Verified
  by actually looking at the decoded output**, not just checking it didn't
  crash: real, legible glyphs across three very different real fonts — a
  Latin/symbol font (`sample_brfna.brfna`), the Wii system menu's CJK font
  (`wbf1.brfna` — readable kana, kanji, math symbols, arrows), and a
  Simplified Chinese font (`fonts_chn/wbf2.brfna` — readable hanzi). `wszst
  xx` now correctly extracts every real `.brfna` sample tried. `t_brfna` in
  `tests/regress.sh` checks real content (PNG file size as a non-blank
  proxy — a genuinely blank sheet PNG-compresses to ~100 bytes, every real
  decoded sheet checked was several KB+), not just "a file exists."
- ✅ **BCFNT (3DS) / BFFNT (Wii U)** — full pixel decode implemented.
  Container structure was verified in a prior session (see commit history);
  pixel decode was the remaining gap.
  - CTR/Cafe format table: format 0 = RGBA8, 3 = RGB565, 5 = IA8, 7 = I8,
    9 = IA4, 10 = I4 — confirmed from NintyFont `texturecodec.h`
    (`PicaTexFormat` enum) and ObsidianX/3dstools `bffnt.py` (same 0–13
    index scheme for both CTR and Cafe).
  - **Encoder bug fixed**: `EncodeBCFNT_RGBA()` was writing `sheetFormat=7`
    (I8/grayscale) while storing RGBA8 pixels. RGBA8 is CTR format 0;
    corrected to `CF_W16(tglp+18, 0)`.
  - **Pixel decode** (`AssignIMG` `NFMT_BCFNT` branch, `lib-image2.c`):
    format 0 (RGBA8 linear) is decoded by direct copy into an `IMG_X_RGB`
    slab — pixel-perfect round-trip. Formats 3/5/7/9/10 are translated to
    the nearest Wii GX `image_format_t` and run through the existing GX
    tile decoder; correct for files with linear pixel data, potentially
    tile-misordered for real retail sheets using CTR Morton-order or Cafe
    micro-tile swizzle (no test file available to verify those cases).
  - `decode_cfnt_if_possible()` added to `wszst.c`; wired into both the
    `extract_one_file()` call site and the `export_models_tree()` deferred
    pass (same two sites as `decode_brfnt_if_possible()`).
  - `extract_cfnt_manifest()` XML comment updated to reflect that pixel
    decode now exists alongside the structure export.
- ⛔ **BCFNA/BFFNA** (the CTR/Cafe font-archive counterparts to BRFNA) —
  not started; no real samples found anywhere on disk to verify an
  implementation against, and BRFNA's own sheet-count semantics were
  already found to differ non-obviously from BRFNT's in a past session,
  so this isn't safe to guess at without a real file.
- ⛔ **BFSAR / BCSAR (Wii U / 3DS sound archives) — checked, answer is no.**
  Searched the actual vendored vgmtrans source tree
  (`src/vgmtrans/src/main/formats/`) rather than assuming: it has
  `RSARScanner`/`RSARFormat`/`RSARInstrSet`/`RSARSeq` (BRSAR, Wii) and
  nothing else Nintendo-sound-related — zero `FSAR`/`CSAR` references
  anywhere in the tree. So there's no free code-reuse win here the way
  mpbin-tools turned out to be; BFSAR/BCSAR would be a from-scratch parser
  (new container format research, real Wii U/3DS samples, likely a new
  `RSARScanner`-equivalent) on the same order of effort as the font work
  in this section, not a quick extension of what `wbrsar` already has.
  Not started.
- 🟡 **BFRES little-endian (Switch variant)** — structure done and
  verified this session against a real sample
  (`~/Downloads/Male.bfres`); geometry decode still open. It is **not**
  "Wii U FRES with byte order flipped" — a completely different,
  undocumented-in-tree layout, confirming the earlier caution here (see
  the BCH-vs-CGFX lesson) was warranted. No reference source in-tree for
  this revision, so it was reverse engineered directly against the real
  sample's bytes (cross-checked against a community wiki table for the
  general shape, then verified field-by-field against the actual file —
  several of the wiki's offsets didn't hold either, e.g. no documented
  FVTX/FSHP/FMAT count fields turned out to exist; counts come from each
  section's `ResDic` dictionary's own entry-count field instead). Key
  differences from Wii U: little endian, version 9+, and **every offset
  is absolute from the start of the file** (Wii U's are self-relative).
  Verified against `Male.bfres`: `FMDL` name "TopL", 2 `FSHP` shapes
  (`body__mt_body`/`body__mt_pants`, each via a *direct* `FVTX` pointer —
  no index indirection like Wii U's fixed-stride array), 2 `FMAT`
  materials, vertex attribute names `_p0`/`_n0`/`_i0` decoded correctly
  via the string table's u16-length-prefix convention.
  What's **not** resolved: the actual vertex/index *data* location. The
  `FVTX` header's obvious "data offset" field doesn't resolve to
  plausible geometry on this sample — neither as a raw absolute file
  offset nor added to the main header's buffer-pool-base field. A
  brute-force scan across the whole file did find a float-shaped region
  with a plausible human-scale bounding box on 2 of 3 axes, but the third
  came back a constant near-zero denormal, meaning either the component
  packing or this exporter's data-offset convention differs from what's
  documented elsewhere. Rather than ship wrong-looking geometry,
  `extract_bfres_switch_manifest()` (`wszst.c`, wired into `XX`) exports
  only the verified structure as XML. `tests/regress.sh` splits the
  previously-shared "FRES" sample test by BOM so Wii U and Switch each
  get tested against their own parser (this file existing on disk was
  silently making the old Wii U DAE test check the wrong parser and fail
  "no geometry" for the wrong reason).
- 🟡 **BFRES/NSBMD sub-variants** — NSBMD's bone hierarchy: done and
  verified this session. NSBMD has no direct parent-index field in the
  bone dictionary itself (unlike most formats this project parses); the
  relationship only exists as a side effect of the "Multiply Current
  Matrix with Bone Matrix" RenderCommand's own parameters. Layout from
  [scurest/nsbmd_docs](https://github.com/scurest/nsbmd_docs) (fetched and
  read directly — a search alone surfaced the repo but not enough opcode
  detail to trust). Added `parse_bone_hierarchy()` in `lib-nsbmd.c`: walks
  the Model's RenderCommandList, and for each "Multiply w/ Bone Matrix"
  command (opcode `0x06` family) records `bone_idx`'s real `parent_idx`.
  Verified against two real retail samples via a standalone test harness
  linked directly against the built objects (`ParseNSBMD()` called
  directly, bypassing the tool layer): `giratina.nsbmd` (26/27 joints now
  correctly parented, multi-limb branching matching a plausible Pokémon
  skeleton) and `kawashima.nsbmd` (a facial rig — `brow_l1→l2→l3`,
  `eye_l1`, `lip_*`, all correctly parented to `face`→`skl_root`) — real,
  semantically sensible hierarchies, not just "some parent got set."
  A second, real bug found while making this end-to-end visible: the DAE
  writer (`lib-model-dae.c`) had a hardcoded "only writing roots here for
  simplicity" shortcut that discarded all non-root joints regardless of
  what any parser supplied — so the correct `parent_idx` data had *no*
  visible effect until this was also fixed (now a real recursive nested
  `<node>` tree, `write_joint_node()`, depth-capped against a malformed/
  cyclic `parent_idx` chain). This limitation applied to every format
  this exporter serves (BFRES/BCH/BCRES too), not just NSBMD.
  A third, unrelated but real bug found in the process: the standalone
  `wmdlt` binary's build was silently broken — it had `TOBJ_wmdlt`/
  `TOPT_wmdlt` configured for the generic tool-build rule but was never
  actually added to `MAIN_TOOLS`/`TEST_TOOLS`/`EXTRA_TOOLS`, so
  `make wmdlt` fell through to GNU Make's bare implicit `%: %.c` rule
  (compiles `wmdlt.c` alone, missing every object it needs) and failed
  with "symbol(s) not found." Fixed by adding it to `EXTRA_TOOLS`.
  Materials and BFRES's FSHU/FTXP-style animation sub-chunks: the
  *container* side is now resolved (see §20: the 12 dictionary slots'
  layout and, empirically over ~1,600 real Wii U files, each slot's
  entry class — FSKA/FSHU/FTXP/FVIS/FSHA/FSCN), only the *entry-internal*
  layout (e.g. FTXP's 0x94-byte entries) remains open.

## 6. Hudson "mpbin" logic — Mario Party 4-8 `.bin` container — ✅ already ported, one real bug fixed

Turns out this was already done: `src/wmpbdump.c`/`src/wmpbpack.c` are a
standalone port of [gamemasterplc/mpbintools](https://github.com/gamemasterplc/mpbintools)
(superseded by the same author's `mpbindump`/`mpbinpack`, same format),
committed in an earlier session (`af55bf9`, "Add LZH8 codec and
QuickLZ/mpbintools standalone tools") — this section originally said "needs
research," which was wrong; should have checked the tree first.

- A `.bin` is an index of sub-files, each tagged with a **compression
  type**: `0` = none, `1` = LZSS, `2`/`3`/`4` = a YAZ0-like sliding-window
  scheme, `5` = RLE, `7` = zlib inflate (via the system `-lz`, already
  linked for libpng). All 5 have real encoders (`CompressLZSS`,
  `CompressSlide`, `CompressRLE`, `CompressInflate`) and decoders, not just
  types 0/1. `dump` extracts to `<bin>_file%d.%s` plus a manifest text file
  (the actual on-disk key is `compress_type=%d: %s`, not
  `compression_type=%d: %s` as mpbintools' own README describes — the two
  tools agree with each other, just not with the upstream prose); `pack`
  does the reverse from that manifest, with an optional C-header of
  file-index `#define`s.
- **One real bug found and fixed this session**: both tools called
  `getchar()` on every error/warning path — a straight, unadapted port of
  the original Windows console EXEs' "press any key to continue" behavior.
  That silently hangs forever under any script, CI runner, or the
  pass-through/`extract_tree()` pipeline this fork uses everywhere else —
  found by actually trying to run it (`wmpbpack` on a 2-line manifest just
  hung with zero output), not by reading the code. Removed all 8 calls
  (3 in `wmpbdump.c`, 5 in `wmpbpack.c`).
- **Verification**: Verified with both synthetic round-trip (`tests/regress.sh`'s `t_mpb`:
  pack → dump → byte-compare, for compress_type 0/1/2/5/7) and real retail fixture
  `~/Downloads/wszst-samples/mp4_mariomdl0.bin` (yielding two valid HSFV037 models).
- ✅ **Wired into `wszst XX`**: `extract_mpbin_file()` in `src/wszst.c` detects Hudson
  Mario Party `.bin` containers, unpacks sub-files (`file%03u.<ext>`), detects subfile
  types (`.hsf`, `.atb`, `.pac`, `.darc`, `.sarc`, `.dat`), and automatically recurses into
  child directories via `extract_tree_complete()`. Tested in `tests/regress.sh`'s `t_mpb`.
- `.atb` (2D image) / `.hsf` (3D model) sub-format *decoding* is still not
  done — `wszst xx` and `wmpbdump` recover the raw sub-file bytes correctly, but
  don't parse the interior HSF/ATB structures yet. Separate follow-up.
  **Update 2026-09-11:** HSF interior is done (parse + GLB export, incl.
  byte-exact re-encode — see the README HSF row, ✅✅✅✅, verified
  again this session: `mp4_mariomdl0.bin` → 2 HSF members → valid
  1.5 MB GLB). Only `.atb` remains, with no ATB sample or reference
  anywhere on disk to build against.

## 7. GotaSequenceCmd — MIDI → BRSAR sequence encoding

`GotaSequenceCmd` is real, identified: [kitlith/GotaSequenceCmd](https://github.com/kitlith/GotaSequenceCmd),
a CLI wrapping [Gota7/GotaSequenceLib](https://github.com/Gota7/GotaSequenceLib)
(C#, GPLv3, "platform-agnostic library for interpreting and playing
sequence data for NintendoWare" — has `Revolution.cs`/`SMF.cs`/
`SequenceCommands.cs`, i.e. it already has the Wii-specific bytecode
writer and a MIDI reader to port from). Not a guess anymore, a concrete
reference to build against.

**A prerequisite gap got found and fixed first, changing the starting
point for this**: `wbrsar` (BRSAR → MIDI + SF2 *decode*) was completely
non-functional against every real `.brsar` sample tried — not a
format-parsing bug. `RSARScanner` (and every other vgmtrans format
scanner) self-registers purely via a global-constructor side effect;
nothing else in the program calls into its `.o` by symbol reference, so a
plain static-library link only pulls in `.o` members that resolve an
unresolved symbol elsewhere, and the linker was silently dropping the
entire scanner. Confirmed with `nm` (zero `RSARScanner` symbols in the
linked binary) and functionally (4 different retail `.brsar` files all
failed identically with "no collections found"). Fixed in the Makefile
(`-Wl,-force_load` on mac, `--whole-archive` elsewhere for
`VGMTRANS_LIBS`) — `wbrsar` now produces real MIDI (verified: valid
`MThd` header, format 1, 13 tracks) + SF2 from a real retail News Channel
`.brsar`. `tests/regress.sh`'s `t_brsar` guards this going forward, trying
each magic-matched candidate in turn since not every real `.brsar` has
RSEQ (sequence) sounds — some banks are SFX/WAVE-only.

This means the decode side (needed to verify any encoder byte-for-byte,
or at minimum structurally) actually works now, which it didn't before
this session — a real foundation to build the encoder against, not just a
theoretical one. **Encoding itself is still not started**: porting
`GotaSequenceLib`'s C# RSEQ writer to this project's C codebase, correctly
handling the bytecode's branch/loop/track-table structure, is a
substantial task on its own, and should still follow this project's
"verify against real playback" discipline (Dolphin or real console) before
calling it done — not attempted this session.

**Update 2026-09-10 (see §27):** the port has since landed as `wseqt`
(disasm/asm/to_midi/from_midi/invert/info over RSEQ/CSEQ/FSEQ/FSEQ_LE/
SSEQ/BMS) and is now verified end to end: synthetic MIDI -> RSEQ ->
MIDI preserves every pitch/velocity in order, disasm -> asm is
byte-exact, and 811/811 retail Wii U FSEQ sequences round-trip
byte-exact with zero unknown opcodes. What remains is coverage, not
existence (Switch FSEQ_LE header version, RANDOM/VARIABLE MIDI value
semantics, real-RSEQ header shape).

## 8. Animal Crossing: City Folk texture bug — ✅ mostly fixed, real gap remains

Root cause found (not a "wrong palette format" bug — the earlier framing
was wrong): BRRES TEX0 carries **no palette of its own at all**; a CI4/
CI8/CI14X2 TEX0 is only ever paired with a PLT0 sibling in the same archive
by naming convention. `AssignIMG()`'s FF_TEX case never looked for that
sibling, so `img.pform` stayed `PAL_INVALID` and the palette-decode switch
in `lib-image1.c` correctly rejected it ("Palette format 0xffffffff").
Confirmed against real retail ACCF disc images pulled via the `wit`/WBFS
pass-through pipeline (`/Volumes/SSD/user/Downloads/Animal Crossing City
Folk Deluxe [RUUE02].wbfs`), not guessed.

Fixed in `lib-plt0.c` (`GetRawPLT0()` — header-only PLT0 parse, no image
decode), `lib-image.h`/`lib-image2.c` (`ExportPNG()` grew an external-
palette override, consumed only when `AssignIMG()` left `pform ==
PAL_INVALID` on an indexed iform), and `lib-szs-create.c` (`extract_func`'s
FF_TEX case + a new `collect_plt0_func` pre-pass that caches every PLT0 in
the archive by base filename before the real extraction pass runs, since
Textures(NW4R)/Palettes(NW4R) group order isn't guaranteed).

Verified end to end, re-confirmed this session against a second real disc
(`/Volumes/SSD/user/Downloads/Animal Crossing - City Folk (USA)
(En,Fr,Es).wbfs`, extracted fresh via `wit`/`wszst XDECODE`, not reused
output): `Insect/ins_taran.brres` → `Textures(NW4R)/ins_taran.png` decodes
to a real 64×128 RGBA image instead of erroring; a small curated copy
(`~/Downloads/wszst-samples/accf_ins_taran.brres`) is now `tests/regress.sh`'s
`t_brres_tex_plt0` case so this can't silently regress. Full-disc sweep of
the USA WBFS: **7477 of 9454 (79.1%) BRRES TEX0→PNG extractions with an
indexed format now resolve a real palette** (was 0% before any of this
palette-pairing code existed — `img.pform` had no override mechanism at
all), across four naming conventions actually observed on disk:
- exact match: `ins_taran` ↔ `ins_taran`
- `_tex` suffix → `_pal`/`_pl`: `int_hsd_art_fine_2_tex` ↔ `int_hsd_art_fine_2_pal`
- `tex_` prefix (or none) → `pl_` prefix: `tex_gaku` ↔ `pl_gaku`, `cf_ch` ↔ `pl_cf_ch`
- short trailing variant suffix stripped: `m_ins_hosokwa_e` ↔ `m_ins_hosokwa`
  (added this session — a texture variant, e.g. a glow/emissive map, sharing
  its base texture's palette under the base's own name)

**Real remaining gap, not a bug in the fix above**: some textures share a
palette that isn't derivable from either name at all — confirmed again this
session on the same disc: `Insect/m_ins_hosokwa.brres` has
`Textures(NW4R)/glow31` but the matching palette is `Palettes(NW4R)/glow28`
— a numbered variant with no shared textual root to guess from. (Also
`fgObjSeason10.brres`'s `tex_treeC_0..4` has no `pl_treeC*`/`tex_treeC*_pal`
anywhere in that archive, from an earlier pass.) The real pairing in both
cases is only recorded in the MDL0 material's texture sampler, which names
both texture and palette explicitly and doesn't need to guess.
Naming-convention matching is fundamentally a heuristic and can't close
this last ~21% — confirmed by testing, not assumed: adding one more
heuristic (the `_e`-suffix strip above) measurably fixed real cases but
left the disc-wide failure count exactly unchanged, because the remaining
failures are numbered variants, a different shape of problem entirely.
Properly finishing this needs an MDL0 material/sampler pass (parse each
material's texture references, which for indexed formats carry the paired
palette name directly) feeding the same `ext_pform/ext_n_pal/ext_pal`
plumbing already built — a bigger, separate task, not a quick follow-up.

**Update 2026-09-11 — closed.** That MDL0 pass has since been built
(`collect_mdl0_palette_func` + `collect_mdl0_linked_palettes`: per-
material texture/palette ref pairs via `mdl0_ref_name`, plus a pooled-
string compat path for unresolved `_pltOffset`s), and the two
"uncloseable" examples from above are covered too (`glow31→glow28`
by the glow-family fallback, `tex_treeC_*` by a dedicated rule, plus
single-PLT0, `palette_name_score`, and `.0`-frame inheritance).
`t_brres_tex_plt0` guards it; full suite green.

## 9. Codec Consolidation — `wajpg` and `wlzh8` folded into `wimgt` / `wszst` — ✅ done

Standalone `wajpg` and `wlzh8` binaries have been dropped from the build:
- **AJPG (Still Image Codec)**: Natively integrated into `wimgt` (`ENCODE file.png --dest file.ajpg`, `DECODE file.ajpg --dest file.png`) and `wszst` via `src/ajpg/odh_core.c` and `AssignIMG`/`ExportAJPG` in `lib-image2.c`.
- **LZH8 (Level-5 / Nintendo DS Archive Codec)**: Natively integrated into `wszst` (`COMPRESS --lzh8`, `DECOMPRESS file.lzh8`) via `lzh8_cmp.c`/`lzh8_dec.c` in `lib-nintendo.c`, and supported via `wbmsx COMTYPE lzh8`.
- Removed standalone binary rules and dropped `wajpg`/`wlzh8` from `TEST_TOOLS` in `Makefile`.
- Added test `t_ajpg_wimgt` in `tests/regress.sh`.

## 10. QuickBMS Script Chaining — `wszst xx --bms=<script.bms>` — ✅ done

Supported QuickBMS script chaining directly in `wszst xx` via the `--bms` CLI option:
- When extracting unrecognized containers or archives that require a BMS script, passing `--bms=script.bms` chains into `wbmsx` / `lib-bms.c` to unpack the container into the staged extraction directory.
- `wszst xx` then automatically inspects and recursively unpacks all extracted child files through its native decoder pipeline (models to DAE, textures to PNG, nested archives).
- Fixed `read_head()` in `lib-passthru.c` to support containers smaller than 1056 bytes.
- Added automated end-to-end regression test `t_wszst_bms` in `tests/regress.sh`.

## 11. 2026-09-08 — Retail-source verification: ZLARC / NES Remix Pack (Wii U) — ✅ done

Re-extracted `"NES Remix Pack (USA) (En,Fr,Es).wux"` via `wszst XX ... --dest
/tmp/szs-nrp --overwrite` (Wii U disc pipeline, already validated working
per an earlier session) and located all four `.zlarc` files the title
ships: `content/Heri1/cmn/miiverse/HankoTga.zlarc` (37,882 bytes),
`content/Heri1/emu/vew/AllVewKey.zlarc` (20,614,540 bytes),
`content/Heri2/emu/vew/AllVewKeyUSEU.zlarc` (15,091,430 bytes), and
`content/Heri2/cmn/miiverse/HankoTgaUSEU.zlarc` (59,768 bytes). All four
start with plain zlib magic `78 da` and `wszst DECOMPRESS` succeeds on
every one, producing 4,968,395 / 182,444,641 / 120,734,071 / 7,129,667
bytes of output respectively. Ground truth: the decompressed payload is a
flat offset-table blob, not a recognized container. `wszst FILETYPE`
reports the payload as `U8` for all four samples, but this is a false
positive from the generic heuristic scorer in `file-type.c` — the payload
doesn't start with `U8_MAGIC_NUM` (`55 AA 38 2D`, see `lib-szs.h`), and
`wszst EXTRACT` on the payload produces nothing but a bare
`wszst-setup.txt` with zero members, confirming there's no real U8
directory to find. So for this title, "ZLARC" as documented in this
project is correctly just "zlib-compressed data" — no fictitious inner
container was invented to force a test past. (The `U8` misdetection on
non-magic data is a minor pre-existing heuristic quirk in
`GetByMagicFT`/`file-type.c`'s scoring table, not something this session's
scope covers fixing — noted here for whoever picks it up next.)

Spot-checked `.bflim`, `.bflyt`, `.msbt`, `.bfwav`, and a zlib-wrapped
`.arc` (`meta/Manual.bfma.d/USA_fr_jpeg.arc`) pulled from the same
extraction tree against `wszst FILETYPE`: all five identified correctly
(`BFLIM`, `BFLYT`, `MSBT`, `BFWAV`, `ZLIB`), confirming the existing
decoders handle this title's real retail data with no regressions.

Committed the smallest sample as
`tests/fixtures/zlarc_wiiu_nes_remix_pack_hankotga.zlarc` (byte-identical
to the retail `HankoTga.zlarc`, verified with `cmp`) and added
`t_zlarc_wiiu_nes_remix()` to `tests/regress.sh`, asserting the exact
4,968,395-byte decompressed size. Full `bash tests/regress.sh` run is
green with no new failures. `README.md`'s ZLARC row's "Retail Source
Tested" column is flipped to ✅ with these exact numbers cited. Scratch
tree `/tmp/szs-nrp` removed after this game's cycle completed, per the
"only one game's scratch tree on disk at a time" rule.

## 12. 2026-09-08 — Retail-source verification attempt: BNFM / Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival (Wii U) — ❌ blocked, README corrected

Extracted `"Animal Crossing - Amiibo Festival (USA) (En,Fr,Es).wux"` via the
same `wszst XX ... --dest /tmp/szs-accf --overwrite` Wii U disc pipeline
(2.2 GiB extracted, ~2:38 wall time; five pre-existing, unrelated
`ERROR #38 [INVALID IMAGE FORMAT]` "Invalid TGLP geometry" failures on
`bbq_no.bffnt` / `bbq_no_f.bffnt` / `bbq_system.bffnt` were the only
errors, and don't touch BNFM). Searched the entire extracted tree for
`.bnfm` files and for the literal `BNFM` magic string in every file:
zero hits. This title ships no bare `.bnfm` anywhere on the disc, which
contradicts the README's prior claim that BNFM was Nd Cube's format for
this specific game.

All of this game's character/item/field model data instead lives under
`content/common/bin/{ch_base/chara,item,bd,insect,indoor,strc,fish,robj}/**/*.bin`
(3,101 such `.bin` files, 873 MiB total) as an undocumented container:
magic `PAC\0`, unregistered anywhere in `file-type.c` (`wszst FILETYPE`
reports it as `?`, and `wszst XX` correctly leaves it untouched rather
than inventing a decode). Manually reverse-engineered just enough of the
container's own layout to confirm what's inside it, without adding any
new decoder to the codebase: header offsets at file offset 0x38/0x3c/0x40
give the entries-table offset, string-table offset, and data-area offset;
the entries table is a flat array of 0x30-byte records, each holding an
absolute name offset into the string table plus a data offset (relative
to the data area) and a size. Walking that table for one real sample,
`content/common/bin/ch_base/chara/cat/cat00.bin` (196,608 bytes, 20
entries), lists a member literally named
`common/ch_base/chara/cat/cat00/cat00.bnfm` (offset 0x2b9e7, size 45,296
bytes) alongside sixteen `.gtx` textures, a `.mcf`, and a `.gmo` sibling.
So BNFM genuinely is one of this game's model formats -- it's just never
exposed as a standalone file.

The payload bytes at that recorded offset are high-entropy and do not
start with the `BNFM` magic; they also fail to inflate under both zlib
and LZMA. Spot-checking one of the plain `.gtx` texture members from the
same container (which should start with GX2's `Gfx2` magic in the clear)
shows the identical high-entropy pattern, confirming the whole data
region of this `PAC` container is encrypted -- not merely a different
compression this codebase doesn't yet speak. Recovering real BNFM bytes
from this title therefore needs a new `PAC` container decoder plus
whatever key/algorithm unwraps its data region, which is out of scope
for a verification-only pass (per this project's standing rule against
inventing new decoders mid-verification).

Net result: no fixture could be harvested, no new `tests/regress.sh`
function was added, and the retail source used in this pass was
Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival, not Mario Party 10, so the BNFM row's
existing ✅ decode/encode/roundtrip columns (presumably earned against a
Mario Party 10 sample) are left untouched. `README.md`'s BNFM row is
corrected: "Retail Source Tested" for *this* title is marked ❌, the
*Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival* attribution is dropped from the
format's game list, and the description now documents the encrypted
`PAC\0` container finding above so the next session doesn't re-walk the
same dead end. Scratch tree `/tmp/szs-accf` removed after this game's
cycle completed. `bash tests/regress.sh` was re-run afterward purely to
confirm no regressions were introduced by this (code-free) investigation;
it still shows only the same 8 pre-existing unrelated failures from
§11/this file's history.

## 13. 2026-09-08 — Retail-source verification: WARC / FZIP / Game & Wario (Wii U) — ✅ done

Extracted `"Game & Wario (USA) (En,Fr,Es).wux"` via the same
`wszst XX ... --dest --overwrite` Wii U disc pipeline. Found real WARC and
FZIP samples: `content/Puzzle/Bmp/Bmp.warc` (106,880 bytes) extracts
cleanly via `wszst EXTRACT` to exactly 93 non-empty `.bmp` members, and
`content/Common/Script.warc.fzip` (76,945 bytes) decompresses via
`wszst DECOMPRESS` to a 771,575-byte payload that is itself a valid WARC
archive, extracting to 241 non-empty `.sttxt` members. Both samples
committed verbatim as `tests/fixtures/warc_wiiu_game_and_wario_bmp.warc`
and `tests/fixtures/fzip_wiiu_game_and_wario_script.warc.fzip`.

`t_warc()` in `tests/regress.sh` updated to prefer the committed fixture
first (same deterministic-pick pattern as `t_bfres_wiiu`), falling back
to the dynamic `find_magic` scan only if the fixture is missing. Added a
new `t_fzip_wiiu_game_and_wario()` test asserting the FZIP fixture
decompresses to a WARC payload that extracts to a non-empty member set.
`README.md`'s WARC and FZIP rows updated with these citation sentences
and WARC's "Retail Source Tested" column flipped to ✅ (FZIP's table has
no such column). Full regress suite re-run afterward: only the same 8
pre-existing unrelated failures from §11/§12, no new failures. Scratch
tree removed after the cycle completed.

## 14. 2026-09-08 — Retail-source verification: TMPK / Twilight Princess HD (Wii U), plus a real gzip pass-through gap — ✅ done

Extracted `"Legend of Zelda, The - Twilight Princess HD (USA) (En,Fr,Es) (Rev 2).wux"`
via the same Wii U disc pipeline. `content/Shaders.pack.gz` turned out to
be a plain gzip stream wrapping a `Shaders.pack` TMPK archive -- and
tracing that through `wszst EXTRACT` surfaced a real gap in
`passthru_7z()`'s dispatch in `project/src/lib-passthru.c`: neither the
gzip magic (`1f 8b 08`) nor the `.gz` extension routed to it at all
(only `.tgz`/`.tbz2`/`.txz`, whose payload is a tar archive, were
wired up), so a bare `.gz` silently did nothing. Fixed by adding both
the magic and extension checks alongside the existing 7z/rar/tar ones,
since 7z already knows how to unwrap a lone gzip stream to its one
contained file. Confirmed end to end: `Shaders.pack.gz` (2,275,927
bytes) unwraps to a 10,402,512-byte TMPK archive that extracts to
exactly 1568 non-empty members, cascading correctly into the existing
`.gsh` Latte shader decoder for the members checked.

Committed gzipped as `tests/fixtures/tmpk_wiiu_twilight_princess_hd_shaders.pack.gz`
(keeping it compressed exercises the new gzip pass-through as part of
the TMPK test, rather than testing TMPK alone). Added `t_gzip_passthru`
(a synthetic round-trip, independent of any Wii U fixture) and
`t_tmpk_wiiu_twilight_princess_hd` (the real retail sample) to
`tests/regress.sh`. `README.md` updated: TMPK's row cites the retail
counts above, and the "7-Zip / RAR / Tar Archives" row is renamed
"7-Zip / RAR / Tar / Gzip Archives" with `.gz` added to its extension
list. First draft of the gzip test asserted the wrong output path
(assumed 7z drops the file straight into the destination directory; it
actually nests it one level deeper under `<name>.d/`) and failed
against the real binary -- caught by re-running the full suite before
committing, not by the manual spot-check that had passed. Full regress
suite: `PASS=387 FAIL=7 SKIP=2`, the same pre-existing unrelated
failures as always, one fewer than earlier sessions in this log because
a concurrent session's NSB/animation work independently fixed the
`ball.glg` regression along the way.

## 15. 2026-09-08 — Retail-source verification attempt: SFZDAT / Star Fox Zero (Wii U) — ❌ blocked, README corrected

Extracted `"Star Fox Zero (USA) (En,Fr,Es).wux"` via the same
`wszst XX ... --dest /tmp/szs-sfz --overwrite` Wii U disc pipeline
(6,709 files, 4.9 GiB extracted, ~2:40 wall time; the extraction itself
completed cleanly with no errors of its own). Searched the entire
extracted tree for `.dat` files and for the literal `DAT\0` magic
string in every file: zero hits for either. The extracted tree is
almost entirely manual/BFLYT assets (224 `.bflyt`, 964 `.bin`, 4,997
Wwise `.wem`) plus `code/PRJ_030.rpx`; none of it is game content.

All of the actual game data instead lives in four CRIWARE CPK archives
under `content/`: `data000.cpk` (1.2 GB), `data001.cpk` (2.5 MB),
`data002.cpk` (863 MB), `data003.cpk` (864 MB). `wszst FILETYPE`
reports these as unrecognised (`?`) -- this project has no CPK support
at all, registered or otherwise. Running `strings` over each CPK's
embedded UTF directory table (CPK stores its filename list in the
clear even when file payloads are compressed) confirms the game does
ship real `.dat` members matching this format's expected shape:
`data000.cpk` alone lists 463 of them (`ba0001.dat`, `0804.dat`, ...),
`data001.cpk` lists 7 (`face_fox.dat`, `shader.dat`, `ShaderSign.dat`,
...), `data002.cpk` and `data003.cpk` list 25 and 160 respectively
(`r200.dat`, `r100.dat`, ...). One raw `DAT\0` byte match was found by
brute-force scanning `data001.cpk`'s own bytes, but manually walking
its header fields (files/offset-table/ext-table/names/sizes offsets)
produced garbage on the second pass -- the header-shaped arithmetic
that looked consistent at first (each offset delta cleanly divisible
by the row count) turned out to be a false positive: CPK entries are
stored CRI-compressed, so the surrounding bytes are high-entropy, and
a 4-byte `DAT\0` match is expected to turn up by chance repeatedly
across ~2 GB of such data. Recovering the real, decoded `.dat` bytes
needs a CPK container reader plus CRILAYLA decompression, neither of
which exists in this codebase; adding either is out of scope for a
verification-only pass.

Net result: no fixture could be harvested, no new `tests/regress.sh`
function was added. `README.md`'s SFZDAT row is corrected: "Retail
Source Tested" is marked ❌, and the description now records the exact
member counts/names found via the CPK strings scan and the CPK/CRILAYLA
gap, so the next session doesn't repeat the same byte-scan dead end.
Scratch tree `/tmp/szs-sfz` removed after this game's cycle completed.
`bash tests/regress.sh` was re-run afterward purely to confirm no
regressions were introduced by this (code-free) investigation; it
shows the same pre-existing unrelated failures as the rest of this log.

## 16. 2026-09-08 — Retail-source verification attempt: G1M / G1T / Hyrule Warriors (Wii U) — ⚠️ big-endian `.g1t` container fixed (synthetic verif.), Wii U decode / `.gz` wrapper still blocked; README corrected

**Update 2026-09-11 — BE branch pinned.** The big-endian `G1TG`
container path (`ExtractG1TArchive`, since moved to `lib-g1t.c`)
was implemented but had no regression coverage (the "verified with
byte-swapped fixtures under /tmp" note left nothing committed). New
test byte-swaps a retail LE fixture's header/table fields and
asserts the BE extract is PNG byte-identical to the LE extract.

**Update 2026-09-11 — `.g1t.gz` wrapper cracked, full Wii U corpus
green.** Pulled the retail WUX (mcubewiiu, 8.5 GB) with the local
title key (plus a lesson: a killed first run's partial tree fooled
the title-folder detector — wipe and re-run, don't resume). Layout
reverse engineered against all 3857 files (every one exact): BE u32
magic `0x10000` + stream count + decompressed size + u32 table, then
size-prefixed zlib streams (`table[i]` = bytes + 4) with zero padding
between them and, on single-texture event_text files, a trailing
sparse entry (no stream; that many zero bytes) plus a 128B per-file
blob (possibly a signature — unverified, accepted only there after
full payload validation). New `DecodeG1TGZ` (+ `IsG1TGZ` probe,
`NFMT_G1T` routing, `.g1t.gz` extraction hook, and a 7z-carve-out so
the weak extension passthrough stops mis-unpacking these as lzma).
Real bugs caught: a scan window anchored at table start instead of
per-gap (died past 64 KB into every file), and display truncation
that repeatedly faked "missing" message fields. Verified: 3857/3857
yield containers; 3DS-format members inside decode to real pixels;
`t_g1tgz` (fully synthetic byte-exact test). Wii U GX2 member pixel
formats (`0x60`/`0x62`) still export raw — their dimension bytes
don't follow the 3DS exponent packing, a separate RE pass.
README row corrected (it still claimed LE-only + cited the old
`lib-nintendo-archives.c` path). The `.gz` wrapper and Wii U GX2
pixel formats remain genuinely blocked (no dump on disk).

Extracted `"Hyrule Warriors (USA) (En,Fr,Es).wux"` via the same
`wszst XX ... --dest /tmp/szs-hw --overwrite` Wii U disc pipeline
(18,569 files, ~7.0 GiB extracted). This is the Wii U original, not
the 3DS *Hyrule Warriors Legends* spinoff the existing G1M/G1T rows
were verified against, so its container/encoding choices needed
checking independently rather than assumed to match.

Two negative findings:

1. **No split `.idx`/`.bin` archive and no bare `.g1m` anywhere.**
   Zero files with either name exist on the disc at all -- the
   Koei Tecmo/Omega Force split-index archive row currently marked
   "(3DS)" is confirmed 3DS-only; the Wii U original doesn't use it.

2. **Almost the whole asset corpus is wrapped in an undocumented,
   proprietary chunked container that isn't gzip despite the `.gz`
   extension.** 5,720 files end in `.gz` (`*.g1t.gz`, `*.bin.gz`,
   etc.); zero of them start with the real gzip magic (`1f 8b`).
   Their actual layout is `BE32 chunk_size(=65536) | BE32 num_chunks |
   BE32 total_decompressed_size`, followed by a `BE32[num_chunks]`
   table of per-chunk compressed sizes -- e.g. `still_menu_EUENG.g1t.gz`
   declares chunk_size 65536, 161 chunks, and a 10,485,844-byte
   decompressed total (161 * 65536 ≈ that total, confirming the header
   read), but the chunk payloads that follow are neither zlib/deflate
   (raw or wrapped, all `wbits` variants tried) nor LZMA -- some
   confirmed-nonzero-size chunks even decode to all-zero bytes under no
   transform, so this is some in-house Omega Force compressor this
   project has no reader for. Every texture (`.g1t.gz`) and most
   scripted/battle data (`.bin.gz`) on the cart lives behind this
   wrapper, so their *G1T contents* (and any `.g1m` that might be
   packed inside) are unreachable without reverse-engineering it --
   out of scope for a verification-only pass.

One real, additional finding along the way: **3 genuine, unwrapped
`.g1t` files do exist** (`content/data/deferred/rain.g1t`,
`content/data/gallery/GalleryEnvMap.g1t`,
`content/data/posteffect/BlurWeight.g1t`) and `wszst FILETYPE`
correctly tags them `G1T`, but `wszst X`/`XX` extracts none of them --
each produces only the empty `wszst-setup.txt`. Root cause identified
in `ExtractG1TArchive()` (`project/src/lib-nintendo-archives.c:3350`):
it requires `memcmp (raw, "GT1G", 4) == 0`, matching the 3DS samples'
byte order (`47 54 31 47`, i.e. `GT1G0600...`), but all three Wii U
files open with the fully byte-reversed `G1TG0060...`
(`47 31 54 47`) -- the same header, stored big-endian on Wii U's
PowerPC target instead of little-endian on the 3DS's ARM target. Every
multi-byte field the function reads after the magic check (`rd_le32`
at offsets 0x08/0x0c/0x10/0x14, and the relative-offset table) would
need the matching `rd_be32` path for this variant. Not fixed here:
adding big-endian support is effectively a second decode path, and
this project's own instructions for this pass draw the line at
verification, not new decoder work -- documented instead so a future
session doesn't have to rediscover it. `wszst X` on the existing 3DS
`tests/fixtures/3ds_samples/koei_g1t/*.g1t` fixtures still passes,
confirming this is a Wii U-only gap, not a regression.

Net result: no fixture could be harvested (the real content is either
absent, in an unread-able proprietary compression, or blocked by the
endian gap above), no new `tests/regress.sh` function was added.
`README.md`'s Hyrule Warriors `.idx`/`.bin` row is unchanged (it
already correctly scopes itself to "(3DS)"); the G1M and G1T rows'
"Retail Source Tested" columns are corrected from ✅ to ❌ with the
findings above, since neither format's *Wii U* retail source actually
verifies (G1M: never found; G1T: found but blocked by the endian bug).
Scratch tree `/tmp/szs-hw` removed after this game's cycle completed.
`bash tests/regress.sh` was re-run afterward purely to confirm no
regressions were introduced by this (code-free) investigation.

### Follow-up (same date): big-endian `G1TG` container support added

`ExtractG1TArchive()` (`project/src/lib-nintendo-archives.c:3350`) now
accepts both signatures: `"GT1G"` (3DS, little-endian) and `"G1TG"`
(Wii U, big-endian). The four header u32s (total, table offset, count,
platform) and the relative-offset table entries are read with `rd_be32`
for the `G1TG` variant; the per-texture headers are pure bytes and are
shared by both paths. Additionally, members whose pixel format is not
in the 3DS set (0x47/0x48/0x09 -- i.e. any real Wii U GX2 encoding)
are now exported raw as `<stem>_NNNN.bin` instead of being silently
skipped, so genuine Wii U `.g1t` files yield data before any GX2
decoder exists.

Verified synthetically (no real Wii U sample is reachable by this repo):
- The two retail 3DS fixtures (`sample_09014.g1t`, 64x256 ETC1A4;
  `sample_10545.g1t`, 128x256) were byte-swapped by hand into
  `/tmp/sample_09014_be.g1t` / `/tmp/sample_10545_be.g1t` (magic →
  `G1TG`, BE u32s in the header and table).
- The BE variants now extract to PNGs byte-identical to the LE ones
  (`cmp` clean), via a small test harness linked directly against the
  rebuilt `lib-nintendo-archives.o` (the real `wszst` binary cannot be
  rebuilt in-tree right now because the other lane's uncommitted
  `ui-wszst` edits break `wszst.o` -- the harness sidesteps it).
- A `G1TG` copy with the member format byte forced to 0xff exports the
  member payload as `<stem>_0000.bin`, byte-identical to the source
  range `0x38..EOF` (21504 bytes).

Limitations recorded: pixel-level decode is only proven for the 3DS
formats; real Wii U texture encodings are exported raw. The `*.g1t.gz`
proprietary wrapper, the plan-requester's `README.md` /
`docs/FORMATS.md` G1T rows, and any GX2 decode work all remain out of
scope.

## 17. 2026-09-08 — Retail-source verification: GFA / BPE / Yoshi's Woolly World (Wii U) — ✅ done

Extracted `"Yoshi's Woolly World (USA) (En,Fr,Es).wux"` via the same
`wszst XX ... --overwrite` Wii U disc pipeline (a first attempt earlier
this session had extracted to plain `/tmp`, which lives on the Mac's
system/boot volume rather than the external `/Volumes/SSD` this whole
task has been budgeting free space on -- it was killed and cleaned up
once the boot volume dropped to single-digit GB free, and re-run
against `/Volumes/SSD/szs-retail-test/tmp-ywwd` instead; extraction
scratch space for this project's own verification work must always go
under `/Volumes/SSD`, never bare `/tmp`).

Found 2,213 `.gfa` files. `content/message_image/msgbox008_00k.gfa`
(148,877 bytes) extracts via `wszst EXTRACT` to a 2-member SARC
(`msgbox008_00k.arc`) that cascades into a real BFLIM texture
(`timg/MsgBoxImage000^q.bflim`) and BFLYT layout
(`blyt/msgbox008_00k.bflyt`) -- confirming the BPE/GFAC decoder fixed
against Kirby's Epic Yarn's retail WBFS in `## 0. Baseline check` also
holds on a second Good-Feel title and a second platform (Wii U rather
than Wii). Committed as
`tests/fixtures/gfa_wiiu_yoshis_woolly_world_msgbox008_00k.gfa`; added
`t_gfa_wiiu_yoshis_woolly_world()` to `tests/regress.sh` asserting the
decoded BFLIM/BFLYT pair actually appears, verified by hand before
trusting the full suite (same discipline as the earlier gzip-test path
bug in `##14`).

Aside, not a bug: many of this disc's smaller `.gfa` files (named like
`test_fujiwara.gfa`, `testmap901.gfa` -- evidently dev leftovers left
in the retail image) have a zero-entry info table and a zero-length
GFCP payload. `ScanGFA()` (`lib-gfa.c`) rejects both with `EINVAL`
(`ERROR #22`), which is the correct behavior for a container with
nothing in it -- confirmed by manually decoding one
(`content/env/mdl/ENV500E.gfa`, 8,218 bytes) and finding `n=0` entries
and `out_len=0` in its header fields, not a decoder defect.

`README.md`'s GFA row updated: `(Wii / 3DS)` context extended to
`(Wii / 3DS / Wii U)` with the citation above. `bash tests/regress.sh`
re-run to completion afterward: same baseline failure shape as prior
entries in this log, new test passes, no regressions. Scratch tree
removed from `/Volumes/SSD` after the cycle completed.

## 18. 2026-09-08 — Retail-source verification: NUT / DTLS / Super Smash Bros. for Wii U — ⚠️ NUT verified ✅, DTLS honest gap documented ❌

Last of the 9 planned Wii U retail-source verification passes.

Extracted the retail Wii U disc image (`Super Smash Bros. for Wii U
(USA) (En,Fr,Es).wux`, 13.7 GiB) with `wszst XX` to
`/Volumes/SSD/szs-retail-test/tmp-smash` (~12 GiB unpacked). Found the
game's `content/dt00` (4,083,470,592 bytes), `content/dt01`
(2,409,697,069 bytes) and `content/ls` (104,664 bytes) — exactly the
DTLS composite-package layout `README.md` already named (`dt00`/`ls`),
i.e. this is the *un-verified* half of that row (only the 3DS side had
ever been checked, per this task's brief).

`wszst FILETYPE` declined all three files (`?`). Manual byte analysis
of the real `content/ls` (Python, cross-checked against `content/dt00`)
found:

- Header: 4-byte tag `"of\x02\x00"` (not `"LS\0\0"`/`"\0\0SL"`, the two
  magics `ScanDTLS()` in `project/src/lib-dtls.c` checks for) followed
  by a little-endian `u32` entry count. Real file: count = 6541.
- Body: 6541 entries of **16** bytes each (not the 24 bytes every path
  in `ScanDTLS()` assumes, including its magic-less BE/LE fallback),
  laid out as `{ u32 hash; u32 dt_offset; u32 dt_span_size; u32 ? }` —
  the header + `count * 16` matches `content/ls`'s real size exactly
  (`8 + 6541*16 == 104664`).
- The offset/size fields are correct: reading `dt00` at each entry's
  offset for its size recovers real content for 4342/6541 entries —
  genuine zlib streams (`0x78 0x9c`) that inflate to known Namco/Bandai
  magics (`NUS3` ×110, `VAT\0` ×44, `SQB\0` ×43, and one `NTP3`, i.e. a
  NUT texture); the other 2199 entries are unpopulated holes (`0xCC`
  fill, the disc's own empty-sector pattern, not decoder failures).
  The unidentified 4th `u32` field is not a simple "compressed" flag
  (many zero-flag entries are genuine zlib streams too), so it wasn't
  chased further this session.

This is a real, reproducible container-format gap: `ScanDTLS()` needs a
fourth branch for this 16-byte/`"of\x02\x00"` variant to accept real
Wii U retail `content/ls` files at all. It was **not** fixed this
session: `project/bin/wszst` could not be rebuilt to verify any fix,
because a concurrent session had left `wszst_cmd/main.inc` referencing
undeclared `GO_WITH_UPDATE_PART`/`GO_EXPORT_MIIS`/`GO_EXPORT_RAW`
identifiers (their WIP, not this task's to touch) — shipping an
unverified binary-format change without being able to compile and test
it against the real sample would break this project's verification
discipline, so it's documented here instead, precisely enough to
implement and verify later.

The one inflated `NTP3` payload found by the above analysis (offset
2,351,399,296 in `content/dt00`, comp size 178,953, decompresses to a
real 65,632-byte NUT file) *is* independently useful: it exercises the
already-implemented NUT decoder (`FF_NUT`, magic `NTP3`) against real
Wii U retail content, which had never been verified for either the Wii
U or 3DS side of this row before. `wszst FILETYPE`/`wszst xx` both
handle it correctly, extracting a real `texture_000.dds`. Fixtured as
`tests/fixtures/nut_wiiu_smash4_texture.nut` (the inflated NUT bytes,
not the raw DTLS container bytes). The raw `content/ls` table itself
is fixtured too, gzipped, as
`tests/fixtures/dtls_wiiu_smash4_content_ls.gz`, purely so the
8+count*16 layout claim above is checked mechanically rather than only
asserted in prose.

`README.md` updated: NUT's Retail-Source column flipped `— → ✅` with
the citation above; DTLS's flipped `— → ❌` with the precise gap
description (the 3DS-side numbers for both rows are left untouched —
this pass only had a Wii U sample to check).

`tests/regress.sh` gained two tests next to the existing (Ultimate,
Switch) `t_smash_retail_arc()`: `t_smash4_wiiu_nut()` decodes and
extracts the real NUT fixture; `t_smash4_wiiu_ls_layout()` mechanically
checks the `content/ls` fixture's `8 + count*16 == size` layout claim
(documentation, not a `wszst` exercise — `ScanDTLS()` still declines
the file). Full suite re-run to completion afterward: same baseline
failure shape as every prior entry in this log (VFF volume, ash0,
wbmsx COMTYPE, NintendoWare sequence, BCSAR/BFSAR canonical ×2, Wii
channel banner), both new tests pass, no regressions. Scratch tree
(`/Volumes/SSD/szs-retail-test/tmp-smash`, ~12 GiB) removed after the
cycle completed.

This closes the planned 9-game Wii U retail-source verification effort
for this task: 6 formats got a real byte-exact/behavioral pass across
the 9 games (ABE BigFile/RGH, WARC/FZIP, TMPK, GFA/BPE, G1T
big-endian, and now NUT), 3 ended in honest, precisely-documented
negatives (SFZDAT/CPK, G1M-G1T/Hyrule Warriors decode, and now DTLS's
real container-layout gap above).

**Follow-up 2026-09-11 — DTLS gap closed.** `dfb3a6e` added the fourth
`ScanDTLS()` branch (`"of\x02\x00"` + LE count + 16-byte entries) and
`lib-file.c` FILETYPE dispatch, but two things were still missing and
are now done: (1) `extract_dtls_file` declined the real retail name —
an extensionless `content/ls` matches no `ls00`/`ls01`/`.ls` gate, so
`wszst xx` wrote zero members; the gate now accepts the exact `ls`
basename and resolves sibling `content/dt00` (stat-first, so a missing
4 GB companion stays silent instead of printing ERROR #78);
extensionless `ls` now extracts all 6541 members even with `dt00`
absent. (2) The 16-byte trailer word was analyzed across all 6541
entries: only 5 distinct values (high u16 ∈ {0,2,4}, low ∈ {0,1});
low=1 entries skew smaller (median 74 KB vs 447 KB), consistent with
a compression flag matching the observed zlib payloads, but without
`dt00` bytes that stays a hypothesis — documented as such in the
README row, whose Retail-Source column is now ✅. Regression test
extended with an extensionless-extract member-count assert. A build
lesson from the same session: a stale `lib-image2.d` referencing a
deleted header made `make` abort before compiling anything (leaving a
stale binary that masked the fix) — worth `rm`-ing orphan `.d` files
after deleting a header.

**Follow-up 2026-09-11 — 3DS DTLS variant + ctrtool verified.** The
§3 ctrtool pass-through proved itself on a real 2 GB Smash 3DS cart
(`exefs`/`romfs` out, incl. a media cascade), and the cart's
`romfs/ls` turned out to be a THIRD DTLS layout: `of\x01\x00` tag +
LE count + 12-byte LE entries (8+4513*12 == 54164 bytes exactly),
all 4513 spans in-bounds against the real 781 MB `romfs/dt`.
`ScanDTLS()` + FILETYPE dispatch extended (entries pass through raw
like the Wii U 16-byte form); the extensionless-`ls` sibling lookup
now tries `dt00` then `dt`. Span forensics: members open with CC
alignment padding and pack concatenated zlib streams (plural per
span — one span held 10+ `ATKD`/`AIPD` streams; all-CC spans are
alignment sentinels), so no sub-container is invented — spans
extract raw and the structure is documented, not decoded. Synthetic
`t_smash3ds_ls` (byte-exact member via sibling `dt`) added; real
pair verified by hand (4513 members, 115/300 sampled with zlib near
head). README DTLS row covers both retail variants now.

## 19. 2026-09-08 — NDS DSi banner: static icon was silently replaced by animation frame 0 — ✅ fixed

Prompted by re-reading a public DSiWare icon-ripper reference script
(the one this project's own `lib-nds-banner.c` was already modeled on)
and noticing it treats the classic 0x20/0x220 icon and the DSi
animated 0x1240/0x2240 block as two wholly separate images, never one
substituting for the other.

`lib-nds-banner.h`'s own documentation already promised this: the
`DecodeNDSBannerIcon_RGBA()` comment for `NDS_BANNER_ICON_STATIC`
reads "a separate bitmap+palette pair and generally does NOT match the
static icon." `ScanNDSBanner()` didn't honor that contract. It set
`bitmap[0] = data + 0x20` / `palette[0] = data + 0x220` (the true
static icon) first, but then, whenever the banner was animated
(version 0x103 with a valid DSi CRC), it looped `for (i = 0; i <
NDS_BANNER_DSI_FRAMES; i++) { bitmap[i] = data + 0x1240 + ...; }`
starting at `i = 0` -- silently overwriting the static slot with DSi
animation frame 0. Every animated DSiWare title's "static icon" export
(`wimgt DECODE banner.bin`, and anything else calling
`DecodeNDSBannerIcon_RGBA(..., NDS_BANNER_ICON_STATIC)`) was therefore
actually the DSi HOME Menu tile's first frame, not the classic 0x20
icon a plain DS (or the DSi's own DS-compatibility mode) would show --
two icons that are frequently drawn or colored differently on real
titles, not near-duplicates.

Fixed in `project/src/lib-nds-banner.h`/`.c`: `nds_banner_t` gets
dedicated `static_bitmap`/`static_palette` fields, always populated
from 0x20/0x220 for any valid banner regardless of animation.
`bitmap[NDS_BANNER_DSI_FRAMES]`/`palette[...]` are now purely the 8
DSi animation slots, with no dual meaning for index 0.
`DecodeNDSBannerIcon_RGBA()`'s `NDS_BANNER_ICON_STATIC` branch reads
the new static fields instead of `bitmap[0]`/`palette[0]`.

Verification: manually traced the CRC16/offset arithmetic in Python
against `nds_banner_crc_ok()`'s exact regions (v1/v2/v3 CRCs at
0x02/0x04/0x06 over 0x20.., the separate DSi CRC at 0x08 over
0x1240..0x23c0 that `ScanNDSBanner()` checks on its own to set
`animated`) and confirmed a synthetic banner accepts cleanly with
`IsNDSBanner()`'s logic. Added `t_nds_dsi_banner_static_vs_animated()`
to `tests/regress.sh`: a synthetic DSi banner whose static palette
entry 1 is pure red and whose DSi frame-0 palette entry 1 is pure
blue (same bitmap shape in both, so only the palette selection can
explain a mismatch) -- a build with the bug decodes "static" as blue,
the fix as red. **Not yet run against the real binary**: `wszst`/
`wimgt` cannot be rebuilt in-tree right now because a concurrent
session's uncommitted `wszst_cmd/main.inc` edits reference undeclared
`GO_WITH_UPDATE_PART`/`GO_EXPORT_MIIS`/`GO_EXPORT_RAW` identifiers
(same blocker recorded against the G1T fix, §16's follow-up). A
standalone test harness linking directly against the rebuilt
`lib-nds-banner.o` (the approach that worked for the G1T fix) hit an
unrelated `ld` "pointer not aligned" failure on a stale `dclib-numeric.o`
and was not pursued further given time already spent; re-run
`t_nds_dsi_banner_static_vs_animated` for real once the build clears.

## 21. 2026-09-08 — BFRES 3.5.0.3 dictionary census: all 12 slots classified on real YWW Wii U corpus — ✅

Wii U BFRES `ResDic` slots were previously only characterised for the
first few; this pass classified all 12 empirically against a full real
extraction of *Yoshi's Woolly World (USA)* (`wszst XX` disc pipeline,
`.gfa` → BFRES + GLB + PNG per file, tree running to
`content/stage/testmap031.gfa`).

Header layout confirmed on real 3.5.0.3 files: relocation/offset
`u32` slots at `+0x20 + 4*slot`, header count `u16` at `+0x50 +
2*slot`, 12 slots; per-slot offset is self-relative to its own
location. Each `ResDic`: `{u32 size, u32 count}` then a sentinel root
node (bitposition `0xFFFFFFFF`, left/right `0`, name/data null) at
`+8`, and `count` 16-byte entries at `dict + 8 + (i+1)*16`: `{u32
bitpos, u16 left, u16 right, u32 name_offset, u32 data_offset}` —
offsets again self-relative — so `object = REL(node, +12)`.

Per-slot entry class, validated over ~1,600 real files by matching
each slot's first entry's object magic against the header's own claim
(and `count == #MAGIC` correlations for FTEX 100% / FTXP 100%):

| slot | offset | u16 | class |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | +0x20 | 0x50 | FMDL |
| 1 | +0x24 | 0x52 | FTEX |
| 2 | +0x28 | 0x54 | FSKA (skeletal anim) |
| 3 | +0x2C | 0x56 | FSHU (shader) |
| 4 | +0x30 | 0x58 | FSHU |

EN075 (enemy) header counts decode cleanly: `nModel=1`, `nFTEX=34`,
`nFSKA=13` (the 13 `.mneb` chapters in its BSON), `nFTXP=11`, and
slots 9/10 hold 5 objects of FSCN (the census shows slot9's object magic is FSCN, count 5, not the "FSHA" the header-count-only read guessed) — slot10 empty on that file. BS02 (boss): 1
FMDL, 33 FTEX, 34 FSKA, 10 FSHU, 35 FVIS (slot7=34, slot8=1).
Section-magic histogram over 1,581 real `.bfres`:
FVTX 43236 / FSHP 43236 / FTEX 16471 / FMAT 8366 / FMDL 2745 /
FSKL 2745 / FVIS 2376 / FSHU 1153 / FTXP 812 / FSCN 50 / FANM 2 —
FVTX==FSHP and FMDL==FSKL 1:1 confirm sibling-section pairing.

Implemented `ParseBFRESArchive()` (`lib-bfres.c`, types in
`lib-bfres.h`) which does all of the above mechanically, and wired it
into `extract_bfres_textures()` (`create_update.inc`): every BFRES
with any animation-class slot prints a `RESOURCES:<file>[<archive>]
FMDL=… FTEX=… FSKA=… …` census line. Verified on real EN075 →
`FMDL=1 FTEX=34 FSKA=13 FTXP=11 FSCN=5`, BS02 →
`FMDL=1 FTEX=33 FSKA=34 FSHU=10 FVIS=34 FVIS=1`, plus the Splatoon
`bfres_wiiu_splatoon_clt.bfres` fixture still exports 1 validated
GLB geometry via `wmdlt ENCODE`.

Incidental: the working tree could not recompile `wszst` (the same
`GO_WITH_UPDATE_PART`/`GO_EXPORT_MIIS`/`GO_EXPORT_RAW` build blocker
noted in §18/§19) until the three `enumGetOpt` members were restored
in the local `ui-wszst.h`/`ui-wkmpt.h` working copies (committed
`main.inc`'s switch cases reference them; the members had been
dropped from the working-tree enum without touching the cases). Left
out of this commit per this task's staging rules; the committed tree
therefore still carries the §18/§19 blocker.

Still open at the time: the *internal* layout of FTXP entries (0x94-byte blocks,
first bytes `46545850 00000744 000015e4 00040000 0000003c
00010001 …`) and FSHU/FSKA/FVIS/FSHA/FSCN entry bodies — the census
decodes the containers, not the animation payloads. (Closed later: see
§26 — entry bodies for all six classes now decode with per-curve
validation against the SDK headers.)

## 22. 2026-09-08 — DTLS gap from §18 now closed: Wii U `"of\x02\x00"` / 16-byte-entry variant accepted — ✅

§18 documented the real Super Smash Bros. for Wii U `content/ls`
layout (`"of\x02\x00"` + LE count, then `count * 16`-byte entries
`{ u32 hash; u32 dt_offset; u32 dt_span_size; u32 ? }`) and left the
fix "precisely enough to implement and verify later" — blocked then
by the same `GO_*` build problem both §18 and §19 recorded (the
`enumGetOpt` members dropped from the working-tree `ui-wszst.h`/
`ui-wkmpt.h` while committed `main.inc` still switches on them; §21
restored them locally so the tree compiles again).

Implemented this session:

- `ScanDTLS()` (`lib-dtls.c`) gained the fourth branch §18 asked for:
  `"of\x02\x00"` header → little-endian count, `entry_sz = 16`, entry
  fields `hash/off/span` read LE, `flags = 0`. The 16-byte variant has
  no per-entry compressed flag or decompressed-size field, so entries
  are exposed as raw `dt00` slices (some are genuine zlib streams per
  §18's byte analysis; deciding which to inflate without a stored
  decompressed size is deliberately left to callers rather than
  guessing). Verified live against the gzipped retail fixture
  (`tests/fixtures/dtls_wiiu_smash4_content_ls.gz`): $n = 6541,
  $8 + 6541·16 = 104664 = file size, offset spans land exactly inside
  `content/dt00`'s 4,083,470,592 bytes (max off+span
  4,083,470,580), and the first entries chain 0/128, 128/128, 256/128
  as expected.
- `GetByMagicFF()` (`lib-file.c`) added `case 0x6F660200: // "of\x02\x00"`
  → `FF_DTLS`, so a real retail `content/ls` now answers
  `DTLS` to `wszst FILETYPE` (previously `?`). `wszst xx` on the real
  file then routes through `extract_dtls_file()` (prints
  `EXTRACT DTLS:… -> …/` and writes the raw `%08X.bin` slices once the
  sibling `dt00`/`dt01` is present; extraction itself was already
  wired in §18-era code). Not changed: the classic `LS\0\0` /
  `\0\0SL` / `SL\0\0` branches (`entry_sz` stays 24 unless the 16-byte
  variant matches), and `CreateDTLS()`.

Side note: this pull's `lib-file.c` hunk is strictly the DTLS row.
Adjoining in the working tree (not committed here) sits §20's
orphaned `case 0x50414300: // "PAC\0"` → `FF_PAC` row — same
function, adjacent lines, whose fixtures/tests landed in that session
but whose magic row was never staged for a commit. The §19
`t_nds_dsi_banner_static_vs_animated` regression likewise remains
uncommitted in the working tree (`tests/regress.sh` carries that
session's unfinished banner test); the full-suite re-run this cycle
exercises it regardless.

## 20. 2026-09-08 — Correction of §12: PAC / BNFM / Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival (Wii U) — ✅ was wrong, now fixed

§12 (above) verified the amiibo Festival retail disc packs every model
and texture inside an undocumented `PAC\0`-magic flat container, walked
its own header/entry table by hand (offsets at 0x38/0x3c/0x40 giving the
entries table, string table, and data area -- all confirmed correct),
found a member literally named `cat00.bnfm` inside `cat00.bin`, and then
concluded the whole container's data region was **encrypted**, because
the payload bytes at that member's recorded offset/size didn't inflate
under a header-framed zlib decompress or under LZMA.

That conclusion was wrong. A public QuickBMS script for this exact
format surfaced since that pass: RandomTBush/RTB-QuickBMS-Scripts,
`Archive/MP10-Unpacker.bms`, header comment "ND Cube - BIN Extractor,
Works with Mario Party 10 and Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival". Its
field layout matches §12's hand-derived offsets exactly (FILEHEADERSTART
at 0x38, STRINGSTART at 0x3c, OVERALLFILESTART2 at 0x40, 0x30-byte
entries with FILESTART/SIZE/ZSIZE/ZSIZE2 fields) -- so the earlier
walk of the container's *structure* was entirely correct. Its
`comtype COMP_UNZIP_DYNAMIC` declaration was the tip that this was some
deflate variant, not encryption. Checked directly against the retail
bytes with a throwaway Python script: `cat00.bin`'s `cat00.bnfm` member
(offset 0x2b9e7-ish per entry, ZSIZE bytes) actually opens with a
completely ordinary zlib header, `0x78 0xda`, and `zlib.decompress()`
(no special windowBits, no raw/headerless deflate) recovers exactly its
SIZE field (45,296 bytes) in one call. All 20 members of that same
`cat00.bin` decode the same way, including sixteen `.gtx` textures that
inflate to genuine GX2 `Gfx2` headers, a `.mcf`, and a `.gmo`. So this
container was never encrypted, and never even needed a raw-deflate
primitive as the QuickBMS `comtype` name might suggest -- it is the
plainest possible zlib stream, and §12's "encrypted" conclusion came
from simply not trying a correct decompress call (or not looking at the
actual first bytes of the compressed span) before giving up.

Implemented a real decoder now that the format is understood:
`ExtractPACArchive()` in `project/src/lib-nintendo-archives.c`, following
this codebase's existing flat-archive family (`ExtractTMPKArchive` et
al. in the same file) -- load the whole file, walk the big-endian
header fields, iterate `FILETOTAL` 0x30-byte entries from
`FILEHEADERSTART`, read each name from `STRINGSTART`-relative to
`FILENAMESTART`, and decompress `ZSIZE` bytes at `FILESTART` with the
already-existing `DecodeZlibGrow()` (`lib-szs.c`) -- which already tries
`windowBits=15` (plain zlib) first and only falls back to `-15` (raw
deflate) if that fails, so this container's plain-zlib members work with
zero new inflate code. Registered `FF_PAC` (265) in `file-type.h`, a
`FileTypeTab` entry and `GetByMagicFF()` case for `"PAC\0"`
(`file-type.c` / `lib-file.c`), and wired `ExtractPACArchive` into
`wszst_cmd/formats.inc`'s `EXTRACT`/`xx` dispatch chain, same as every
other flat-archive format in that file.

Verified against the retail disc with `wszst FILETYPE`/`EXTRACT` (real
build, not just the throwaway Python check): the minimal 2-member
`content/common/bin/bd/indoor/idr_fortune_bq.bin` (4096 bytes) extracts
both real `.csv` members, and the 20-member `cat00.bin` (196,608 bytes)
extracts all 20 -- including a valid `cat00.bnfm` and sixteen real
`Gfx2`-tagged `.gtx` textures -- exercising the full entry-table/name-
table loop, not just a single member. Both harvested as new
`tests/regress.sh` fixtures (`t_pac_wiiu_amiibo_festival`):
`pac_wiiu_amiibo_festival_idr_fortune_bq.bin` (committed verbatim) and
`pac_wiiu_amiibo_festival_cat00.bin.gz` (gzipped, since the payload was
already zlib-compressed and doesn't shrink much further).

`README.md`'s BNFM row is corrected back: "Retail Source Tested" is now
✅, the *Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival* attribution is restored, and
the description points at the real fix instead of the false "encrypted"
claim. A new **PAC (Nd Cube)** row is added to the Archives & Containers
table, distinct from the pre-existing unrelated "PAC / MRG" row (HAL
Laboratory / Game Arts, different magic, same `.pac`-adjacent naming
only by coincidence).

## 23. 2026-09-09 — BCFNT/BFFNT: real Wii U fonts are ETC1 (CTR fmt 12); the TGLP "geometry" clamp now reports the truth — ✅

**Finding (via the live YWW `wszst xx` campaign).** Extraction kept
soft-noting `Invalid TGLP geometry in BCFNT/BFFNT` for
`content/debug/MS_Gothic_16.bffnt` and `DynaFont_NW_Demo.bffnt`. Probing
the real bytes showed why: the TGLP stores `sheetSize=0x80000`,
`sheetCount=14`, `width=height=1024`, `sheetFormat=0xc`, `dataOffset=0x2000`
(section spans 0x34..0x182000, CWDH follows). CTR format 12 = **ETC1**, and
for ETC1 the per-sheet size IS the true compressed size (512 KB = one
1024×1024 ETC1 sheet) — but the 14 sheets are packed tighter than
`sheetSize*count`, so the plain "all sheets fit the file" sanity check
rejected a perfectly valid retail font as "Invalid TGLP geometry".

**Fix (lib-image2.c, the NFMT_BCFNT AssignIMG branch).** The format-support
decision now runs BEFORE the sheet-space check: `ctr_to_gx[]` is hoisted to
the top of the branch, and an unsupported format (incl. ETC1/ETC1A4, and
the RGB8/RGBA5551/RGBA4444/HL8/A8/A4 no-GX-equivalent ids) returns the
honest `BCFNT/BFFNT: unsupported sheet format %u` error; the "doesn't fit"
check is kept for the formats we actually decode (where full-size sheets
are genuinely required). Bonus: the early return happens before any sheet
data is dereferenced, so a corrupt `sheetSz` can't cause an out-of-bounds
read on a format we never decode.

**Verified.** `wimgt DECODE` on both retail fonts now reports `unsupported
sheet format 12` instead of bogus geometry corruption; the fork's own
synthetic RGBA8 `.bffnt`/`.bcfnt` still decode to PNG; full regression
re-run stays at the clean baseline. ETC1/ETC1A4 sheet *decoding* remains
unimplemented (out of scope — a codec port, documented here for whoever
wants it; the structure XML sidecar already exports the correct sheet
layout).

## 24. 2026-09-09 — Yoshi's Woolly World: full-title pass COMPLETE, full BFRES resource census collected — ✅

**The campaign pass on YWW finished cleanly.** `wszst xx` on the 8.8 GB
`.wux` walks the whole disc: 30 GB `.d` tree (code/meta/content), 139,661
log lines, every `.gfa`/`.bflim`/`.bffnt` unpacked, every `.bfres` model
exported to `.glb` (incl. the worldmap/covers), all 23 content areas done.
Only decoder-level notes: 36× `ERROR #38 INVALID IMAGE FORMAT` (the two
ETC1 debug fonts from §23, plus `[file type=LZOVL]`, `[file type=...]`
image cases — all correctly identified-but-unsupported, not crashes).

**Operational lesson (cost 5h):** `wszst xx` terminates with **rc=28
"finished, but warnings were produced"** on *successful-but-noisy*
extractions — the tool does NOT crash at the end; an auto-restart watchdog
backing onto `rc != 0` silently deleted five complete/rebuilt trees in a
row. Decision rule for future passes: treat **rc=28 = PASS with notes**;
only `rc != 28 && rc != 0` is a real abort. (The default `stdcli` exit
table puts exit code 28 on "warnings present".)

**Full-corpus BFRES census (plus-build `xx` per `.bfres`, 1768 archives).**
All 1768 decode without blocking errors; 1018 carry non-(FMDL/FTEX)
"animation-class" slots and printed a census line. Totals:

```
FMDL=3645  FTEX=16574  FSKA=5183  FSHU=1495  FVIS=2808  FTXP=816  FSHA=438  FSCN=26
```

Archive counts per animation resource class: FSKA 794, FSHU 427, FVIS 426,
FSHA 109, FTXP 48, FSCN 11. No unexpected 4CCs slipped through — the
BFRES v8/v9 header dict path handles every slot class YWW contains.
(FSCN=26 scene resources is the rarest class and the one with no decoder
yet — a natural next target if scene/animation research continues.)

## 25. 2026-09-09 — NintendoWare gaps: CTXB multi-entry ✅ fixed; Cafe BFFNT sheet formats ❌ blocked with evidence

Two gaps from the format-table review this session, one closed and one
honestly blocked:

**CTXB ✅ fixed.** `AssignIMG()`'s `ctxb` branch (`lib-image2.c`) only
ever tried texture entry 0 of each `tex ` chunk. Real romfs CTXB files
pack several 36-byte entries per chunk and entry 0 is not guaranteed
decodable, so such files failed outright with "Failed decoding CTXB
texture". The branch now walks every entry (`t` in `0..tex_count-1`,
per-entry bounds check) across all chunks via the same
`DecodePicaTexture()` call — single-entry files behave byte-identically
to before. Proven by old-vs-new binary comparison on a synthetic
2-entry fixture (bogus entry 0 with `w=h=0`, valid RGBA8 entry 1):
old `wimgt` fails, new `wimgt` decodes. Guarded by a new
`tests/regress.sh` case ("decoding with bogus first entry") next to
the existing single-entry CTXB test. Full suite green afterwards
(`PASS=399 FAIL=0`).

**Cafe (Wii U) BFFNT sheet pixel formats ❌ blocked — implemented,
visually checked, then reverted.** The hypothesis was that Wii U
`fmt 0x0c` sheets are CTR-table ETC1 (the 3DS meaning of 12) decodable
through the already-verified `DecodePicaTexture()` path. An ETC1
branch was written and run against the real retail YWW debug fonts
(`content/debug/MS_Gothic_16.bffnt`, 1024×1024, 14 declared sheets;
`DynaFont_NW_Demo.bffnt`, 128×1024) — and the output was saturated
colour noise under all four ETC1 variants tried (LE/BE block words ×
linear/Morton-8×8 block order, checked with an independent Python
ETC1 implementation), not glyph atlases. The branch was reverted
rather than ship wrong pixels; `wimgt DECODE` on these files is back
to the honest `unsupported sheet format 12` error. Evidence that
this is a real format-table gap, not a decoder bug:

- Latte (Wii U GPU) is AMD-based and has no ETC1 hardware — a Wii U
  sheet is unlikely to be ETC1 at all; `0x0c`/`0x0e` (the latter seen
  on `content/font/ALL/Font02/03/04.bffnt`, beyond the CTR table's
  0–13 range entirely) belong to a Cafe-specific enum this codebase
  has no oracle for.
- Even the RGBA8 retail font (`Font00.bffnt`, `fmt 0x0`, sheet size
  exactly `64*1024*4`) fails the branch's own `sheetSz*cnt ≤ file`
  geometry check (22 declared sheets vs ~1 stored) and a raw linear
  read of its sheet 0 renders as yellow striping, not glyphs — so
  retail Cafe sheets are not plain-linear either (micro-tile swizzle
  or another transform, as the code's own tiling-caveat comment
  already suspected). Fixing that needs a Cafe GPU format oracle
  (SDK docs or a hardware-swizzle reference), not more guessing here.

## 26. 2026-09-09 — BFRES Switch vertex data ✅ fixed; Wii U anim entry bodies ✅ decoded (SDK headers); BCFNA/BFFNA ❌ no such format

The NintendoSDK dump on disk (`sdk-develop`, Siglo repo) turned out to
hold the actual NintendoWare G3D resource headers
(`Programs/Iris/Include/nw/g3d/res/g3d_Res*Anim.h` — ResFile, ResCommon
(Offset/BinString/BinaryFileHeader), ResDictionary (Patricia),
ResAnimCurve, and all six animation entry layouts) plus five real Wii U
BFRES 3.5.0.3 samples (`Tests/.../EftSandbox/Resorce/g3d/*.bfres`,
with a `ConvertG3d.bat` showing the `.fmdb`+`.ftxb`(+`.fskb`) ->
`NW4F_g3dbincvtr.exe` build workflow). The `.fmdb`/`.fskb`/`.ftxb`
sidecars are 59-byte Git-external-storage pointers, not data -- but the
`.bfres` outputs are real. No `nn/g3d` (Switch) headers and no Switch
`.bfres` anywhere in the dump; the Switch side stayed a
Male.bfres-driven RE job.

**Switch vertex data ✅.** `ParseBFRESSwitch()` failed every v9 file
(`wmdlt` on Male.bfres: hard "Failed to parse 3D model") because the
BufferInfo pointer it read at header+0x90 is 0 there -- v9 inserts the
documented 32-byte reserved block ahead of it, moving the pointer to
+0xB0 (v8 keeps +0x90). Verified structurally, not assumed: +0xB0 aims
at a valid {unk=36, size=40960, pool=122880} triple with header+0xA8 ==
pool+size, the FMDL->FSHP->FVTX chain resolves with zero slack
(530×20=10600, 692×20=13840), both vertex bboxes are human-scale on
all three axes, and both index buffers max out at vcount-1 with full
vertex coverage. The reader now takes either slot version-gated, with
struct-bounds validation. Male.bfres -> real 2-mesh GLB; synthetic-v8
round-trip unaffected. Still open: v10 files, skinning on real Switch
data, exotic component formats, LODs past LOD0.

**Wii U anim entry bodies ✅.** Our `bfres_curve_read()` matches the
SDK's `ResAnimCurveData` field-for-field (flag bits, S10.5 frames,
cubic/linear eval), and the entry/dict/curve-array address math in
`ParseBFRESAnims()` (new, `lib-bfres.c`) was checked entry-by-entry
against real files before it was written -- including two self-inflicted
probe bugs it caught along the way (BinStrings are 4 bytes, not 8;
MatAnim/VertexShapeAnim curve arrays sit at sub-offset index 2, not 1).
`wszst XX` now prints one `ANIM:` summary line per file (class counts,
frame ranges, validated/total curves); every curve validates 100% on
all samples tried (BS02: 1611 FSKA + 19 FSHU + 37 FVIS; EN075: 293
FSKA, 11 constant-only FTXP, 5 empty FSCN stubs; ENV303: 32 FSHA;
SDK effectDemoCar: 7/7 FSKA). Five fixtures committed
(`tests/fixtures/bfres_anim_*.bfres`, ~480 KB total) with a `t_bfres_anims`
regress case asserting the exact summary strings. No GLB export for the
non-FSKA classes -- none of them map onto node TRS channels (material
params, visibility bits, texture swaps, morph weights, scene cameras),
so structural decode is the honest stopping point; FSCN has no
non-empty sample anywhere (all five EN075 entries are zero-count stubs)
and gets parser coverage without a dedicated fixture.

**BCFNA/BFFNA ❌ closed, no such format.** Zero references anywhere in
the SDK dump (Programs + Documents); the archived-font concept exists
only as Wii BRFNA. Not implementing phantoms -- the earlier "not
started" note is retired, not worked.

## 27. 2026-09-10 — SYMB-less Wii U BFSAR asset extraction ✅; sequence fidelity overhaul ✅ (SDK MML oracle)

Two related pieces, both grounded in the SDK dump's `nw/snd` headers
*and* sources (`snd_MmlParser.cpp`, `snd_SoundArchiveFile*.{h,cpp}`).

**BFSAR extraction ✅.** `wbrsar` on retail YWW `pj023.bfsar` (12 MB,
FSAR v2.2.0, no SYMB section) failed twice over: vgmtrans has no FSAR
support and `UnpackBRSAR` demands SYMB. The directory side already
worked (`wbfsar dump`: 7 tables, 1898 named entries). The missing link
was the INFO File table -> FILE pool mapping: entry offsets are
relative to their ReferenceTable (`GetReferedItem` adds to `this`),
and each record carries the embedded InternalFileInfo image reference
at +16/+20 (pool-relative offset + size). Verified on all 926 entries:
821/821 non-empty ones resolve to known container magics. New
`wbfsar extract` carves them as `fileNNNN.<ext>` (magic convention
mirroring lib-sound-archive.c) plus `files.txt`: 811 FSEQ, 4 FBNK,
5 FWAR, 1 FWSD. Every FSEQ converts to a valid MIDI. Not yet mapped:
Sound -> File name linkage (needs sound-item internals), FWAR-internal
wave extraction (FWARs carve intact; waves decode once unwrapped).

**Sequence fidelity ✅.** Extracting 811 real FSEQ sequences exposed
that the RSEQ-family walker had never actually worked on real files:
(1) DATA lives at 0x40 via the file block table
(`SoundFileHeader` + `BlockReferenceTable`, DATA 0x5000 / LABEL
0x5001), not at the legacy +0x10 offset the reader assumed -- every
real FSEQ disassembly started mid-header; (2) the 0xF0 extended
command had no skip/parse anywhere, desyncing every file that uses it
(948 hits); (3) A0-A5 are *prefixes* wrapping the next command
(IF/TIME/RANDOM/VARIABLE per `MmlParser::Parse`), not standalone
commands -- misreading them desyncs too (953 hits); (4) the assembler
emitted an RSEQ-shaped header (ver 0x0001, no LABL) under the FSEQ
magic; (5) `#` comment-stripping ate sharps in note names (all 35
round-trip failures were sharp-containing files). All fixed per the
SDK sources, including exact operand widths (notes: vel u8 + VMIDI
gate; EX subs: u8+s16 / u8 / s16 by high nibble; s16/robot args
endian-aware; s16pair RANDOM bounds). The disassembler prints
`ex`/`if`/`random`/`variable`/`time*` forms plus all 30 previously
unprinted u8/s16 commands and real LABEL-block names as `label`
directives; the assembler parses them back and emits the true
BinaryFileHeader container (ver 0x20000, 32-padded DATA/LABL).
Measured on all 811: **zero unknown opcodes, 811/811 byte-exact
round-trips, 811/811 valid MIDIs** (MIDI also walks past FIN/RET
subroutine terminators now instead of stopping at the first one).
Two tiny fixtures (`fseq_wiiu_yww_0000/0800.bfseq`, 160/608 bytes)
with a `t_fseq_wiiu_roundtrip` case. Still open: Switch FSEQ_LE header
version (mirrored, no sample), VARIABLE/RANDOM MIDI value semantics
(midpoint/0 documented simplifications), real-RSEQ header shape
(block-first with legacy fallback; no retail sample to confirm).

## 28. 2026-09-10 — BFSAR Sound->File names were plausible-but-wrong; string stride fixed ✅

`wszst xx` on retail YWW `pj023.bfsar` produced 2448 files with
convincing names (`0001_STRM_BGM72.bfseq`, ...) -- every one of them
suspicious on close inspection (a STREAM sound naming an FSEQ file;
`0800.bfseq` left unnamed despite carrying a real `SD_BGM_MUTYO13`
sequence). Root cause in `lib-sound-archive.c`'s STRG walk: 8-byte
record stride where the true layout (same 12-byte
`{type,offset,size}` records `lib-bfsar.c` already used, string bytes
at block+offset+24) is 12. Entry 0 resolves either way, so the bug
was invisible on trivial samples; past it, every lookup aliased onto
a nearby real string -- wrong file, right-looking name. Verified by
replicating the exact read path in Python (sound 114's bogus index
lands on the true `STRM_BGM72` bytes) and by the corrected tree:
`0001_SD_OK1` (sibling of the file's own `SD_OK2` label),
`0002_SD_GOAL1` (exact match with its LABL), 2434/2448 names changed.
Fix is one stride + bounds change; guarded by a pj023-pinned
regress assertion (`*_SD_GOAL1.bfseq` exists -- absent under the old
code). FWAR-internal waves needed no work: `0818.bfwar.d/*.bfwav`
decode to valid 32 kHz WAVs bit-identical to the previous campaign's
output.

## 29. 2026-09-10 — Real Wii RSEQ verified; Switch NSP opened, no FSEQ inside ✅/❌

**Wii RSEQ ✅.** Three retail Wii-system BRSARs (`IplSound`, `1`,
`IplSoundz`) unpack to three unique real RSEQ sequences (Wii menu
music). Findings: (1) real RSEQ uses direct DATA/LABL offsets
(+0x10/+0x14/+0x18/+0x1C), not the FSEQ block table -- the reader now
tries the table first and falls back, so synth files keep working;
(2) RSEQ LabelInfos are compact `{data_off,len,name}` (vs FSEQ's
`{ref,len,name}`), now read (real `SMF_1_Track_*` names in output);
(3) all three disassemble with zero unknown opcodes and reassemble
code-exact (the legacy assembler shape drops the LABL block, whose
entry first-word semantics stay undetermined -- documented, not
guessed); (4) 16-track MIDI renders complete (75 KB from the menu
BGM). Two fixtures (`rseq_wii_menu_bgm*.rseq`, 7/16 KB) with a
`t_rseq_wii_roundtrip` case asserting no-raw + real labels +
code-exactness + MIDI validity.

**Switch NSP ❌ (for sequences).** F-ZERO 99 unpacks cleanly with the
available hactool+keys (PFS0 -> NCA -> romfs, 1.1 GB): no BFRES
anywhere, and SoundData holds only metadata BFSARs (FSAR LE v2.6.0,
which dump with real names). LE structural parsing confirmed on the
same files. Zero FSEQ anywhere on the disc; the Switch FSEQ_LE
header version stays unverified, as does anything needing a Switch
BFRES sample (v10, skinning).

## 30. 2026-09-10 — Switch v10 skeletons + skinning via Tomodachi Life ✅

Tomodachi Life (Switch, 2026) ships 2284 zstd-packed BFRES v10 files;
all decompress and all 2043 with geometry decode (241 skips are
legitimately empty: 235 anim-only, 6 skeleton/placeholder-only).
Skeletons had never worked (0 joints anywhere): the old FSKL field
map read every v9+ field 8 bytes late. Per BfresLibrary's
Skeleton.cs/Bone.cs, verified byte-for-byte on real v9 (Male: 27-bone
TopL hierarchy) and v10 (penguin: 8-bone Root hierarchy with
bilateral symmetry): prologue is flags/dict/array/mtxlist/invmtx/
user/mirror/counts, bones are 0x58 stride on v10+ (extra Seek(8) vs
Seek(16)) with parent/TRS shifted and euler-or-quaternion rotation
(2047 euler files vs 1 quaternion file in-corpus; both handled).
Skinning needed two more retail facts: indices live in `_i0`
(8_8_8_8_UInt), not `_b0`, and zero-weight verts carry the 0xFF
unbound marker (bound rigidly to joint 0, matching the exporter's own
default, so one mesh's 24 such verts don't veto the other 848).
Result: 383/383 files with complete skin data export skins with
in-bounds joints. Two fixtures (penguin + quat-mode SceneMaterial)
with a `t_bfres_switch_v10` case (8 joints, 1 skin).

## Suggested order

1. §2 (mechanical, minutes) + §8 (concrete bug, real user pain).
2. §3's `hactool` addition and CUE BLZ/Huffman port (extends a pattern
   that's already proven, per §0).
3. §4 (QuickBMS/zlib) — bounded scope, clear reuse of the existing
   `decompress_nintendo_file` dispatch shape.
4. §5/§6/§7 — each needs a research pass (samples + oracle) before any
   code gets written, per this project's verification discipline. Don't
   start implementing until that research step is done for each one.

## 30. 2026-09-10 — Retro Studios TXTR support (issue #63) ✅ decode both / ✅ encode old

**Old revision** (*Metroid Prime 1-3*, *DKCR*, Wii): BE header (u32 GX
format 0-0xA, u16 w/h, u32 mip count), optional palette header for
C4/C8/C14X2, then GX-tiled mip data — no file magic of its own.
Spec from the Retro Modding Wiki TXTR (Metroid Prime) page;
encode/decode semantics cross-checked against xchellx/txtrtool's
TXTR_Read/TXTR_Decode (header/palette layout, mip halving, indexed
formats). Pixel codec reuses this tree's own `DecodeGXTexture_RGBA`
(lib-excite.c), so no new tile code; the encoder (`EncodeRetroTXTR_RGBA`)
is the exact inverse tile walk (CMPR via the existing `CMPR_wiimm`
block encoder). C14X2 has no decoder anywhere in this tree and fails
cleanly (no official texture uses it per the wiki).

**New revision** (*Tropical Freeze*, Wii U): RFRM form (`TXTR` id at
0x14) + HEAD chunk (type/format/dims/tilemode/swizzle/mipmaps) + GPU
chunk (LZSS modes 0-3 per the wiki's LZSS_Compression C reference,
zlib fallback mirroring the reference `lzz_decompress.py`) + META
buffer table, decoded through the existing GX2 detiler. Retro format
ids map to GX2 base formats (storage footprint is what the detiler
needs); pitch prefers the reference's alignment/2 derivation but falls
back to the GX2 minimum pitch when it overshoots the buffer (caught by
a synthetic 8x8 test where alignment/2 = 256 vs width 8). 2D depth-1
only; encode not implemented (GX2 re-tile + RFRM/LZSS rebuild).

**Name-collision handling**: all three "TXTR" formats coexist — DSB
(`TXTR` magic) keeps priority in `AssignIMG`/`DetectNintendoFormat`,
Tropical keys off `RFRM`+id, old Retro off a header heuristic that
rejects both magics. New `NFMT_RETRO_TXTR`/`NFMT_TROPICAL_TXTR`
registry entries; no new `FF` (matches the DSB precedent — `FILETYPE`
still reports `?`, as it already did for DSB). Link placement follows
the `IsQuickLZ` weak-stub pattern: parsers live in XOBJ_IMAGE
(`lib-retro-txtr.o`), SZS_O-only helpers keep working via stubs.
`wimgt DECODE`/`ENCODE` (`.txtr` → old-revision encode) + `wszst xx`
via the shared `is_image` probe. `tests/regress.sh`: synthetic RGBA8
decode + byte-exact re-encode, C8 indexed decode, synthetic RFRM/mode-0
Tropical decode with gradient pixel asserts. Full suite green
(PASS=411, only 2 pre-existing unrelated audio FAILs).

## 31. 2026-09-10 — Factor 5 VID1 DivX demux — REVERTED

The native demuxer described below was removed the same day it landed:
video decoding is mobipeg's job, not wszst's. `lib-vid1.c`,
`FF_VID1`, `extract_vid1_file` and the regress fixture are gone;
`.vid` files route to the mobipeg/ffmpeg media pass-through
(weak claim, unchanged) and are otherwise left untouched. The
MultimediaWiki "Factor 5 VID1" notes are preserved here in case
mobipeg-side work ever needs them: `VID1` root + `HEAD`/`VIDH` +
`FRAM` chunks with `VIDD` (cut-down MPEG-4 Part 2, DivX 5.02 based)
video + `AUDD` audio payloads, all BE sizes.

(Original entry, kept for provenance — implementation reverted:)

**Container** (`VID1` root + `HEAD`/`VIDH` + `FRAM` chunks with `VIDD`
video + `AUDD` audio payloads, all BE sizes): new `lib-vid1.c`
(`ScanVID1`/`ExtractVID1`, same entries-shape as `ExtractTHP`), new
`FF_VID1` file-type entry (`VID1` magic, `.vid`), `extract_vid1_file`
hooked after `extract_thp_file` in `formats.inc`, `lib-vid1.o` in
`SZS_O`. `wszst FILETYPE` reports `VID1`; `wszst EXTRACT` demuxes to
`frame_*.vidd` + `audio_*.audd` + `info.txt` (dims/fps/counts).
Pass-through is weak-only by design: no ffmpeg/mobipeg build demuxes
VID1's FRAM container, so a magic-strong claim would route real files
to a tool that can't read them and shadow the native demuxer — native
gets first refusal, plain-AVI `.vid` files still get an mp4 attempt.

**Not done**: VIDD pixel decode (cut-down MPEG-4 Part 2, DivX 5.02
based with I/P/B/S frames + GMC — a full video codec, out of scope),
AUDD Vorbis reconstruction. Structure per the MultimediaWiki
"Factor 5 VID1" page + `Vid1VideoFile.cs` offsets (HEAD children at
+0x0C, VIDH dims/count/rate fields, FRAM children at +0x20);
`tests/regress.sh`: synthetic 2-frame fixture (FILETYPE tag,
byte-exact `frame_00001.vidd` payload, `info.txt` dims, truncated
file rejected). **No retail `.vid` sample checked yet** — offsets
need confirmation against real data (e.g. Tony Hawk's Underground
1/2, Enter the Matrix) before pixel work starts.

## 32. 2026-09-10 — VID1: native demux reverted, pixels via external decoder ✅

**Direction change**: the `lib-vid1.c`/`FF_VID1`/`extract_vid1_file`
native demux from §31 was reverted out of the tree (passthrough-only
for `.vid`, same as every other video format here). What stays is a
pixel path with no in-process codec: `PassthruDecodeVID1()` +
`VID1DEC=`/`NeversoftMultitool`-on-PATH resolution, called from the
weak pass-through for `VID1`-magic files (never mobipeg/ffmpeg for
magic files — see below); bare-`.vid` files with no magic stay in the
generic media group.

**Retail verification** (*Carmen Sandiego: Secret of the Stolen
Drums*, GameCube, `P-G3DE/files/Movies/*.vid` — A2M/BAM game using
the Factor 5 DivX SDK): the §31 container layout holds exactly —
`VID1` root (0x20) → `HEAD` at root.end → children at HEAD+0x0C →
`VIDH` (640x480, 1801 frames, 2997/100 fps) → 1801 `FRAM`s from
HEAD.end, children at FRAM+0x20, exactly 1801 `VIDD` + 1801 `AUDD`.
All 21 I-frames carry the optional header, 1780 P, zero B/S, no
custom quant matrices anywhere, coded offset uniformly 12.

**Why external, not a remux**: a standards-conformant MPEG-4 VOL +
per-frame VOP headers around the raw macroblock payloads was built
and probed (this found two real spec details: start codes must be
byte-aligned after the 5-bit VO section, and the stream needs a
video-object start code or ffmpeg's m4v probe scores it 0). The
remux OPENS and every VOP header hand-parses clean — but decodes to
noise, because per-macroblock type/code tables live in Factor 5
control words, not in the payload. A full in-process decoder would be
a ~20-file port of neversoft-multitool's validated C# pipeline
(VLC tables, control prefixes, IDCT, motion/GMC) — out of scope;
their tool instead runs as the backend here.

**Pixels proven**: their `vid` CLI on retail `Demo.vid` (18 MB)
yields perfect 640x480/29.97 cutscene frames (viewed: jungle-fortress
fight, "19" collectible UI); `wszst EXTRACT Bam.vid` with
`VID1DEC=` set writes `Bam.d/Bam.mp4` end-to-end (5 s ident,
BAM logo frame verified); without the tool the file skips cleanly
(exit 0). Carmen `AUDD` is 1880-byte packets with no Vorbis/Ogg
magic — not the THAW custom-Vorbis their audio path converts, so
previews are video-only; audio stays open.

**Option note**: no `--with-vid1dec` CLI flag — `src/ui/ui.def`
currently cannot regenerate (committed `ui/ui-wszst.*` contain
`GO_WITH_UPDATE_PART`/`GO_EXPORT_MIIS`, but HEAD's `ui.def` never
defined them, so running `./gen-ui` now *drops* those enums and
breaks the build; also an empty stray `project/gen-ui.c` shadowed
the real `src/ui/gen-ui.c` until removed). Config is
`VID1DEC=/path/to/binary` or PATH auto-detect until the UI tables
are unfrozen.


## 32. 2026-09-10 — Metroid Prime Remastered PACK container (Switch `.pak`) ✅ extract

Retail romfs available (6.7 GB: per-area paks, `DuplicateData.pak`
1.6 GB, `MaterialArchive.arc`). The `.pak` is a new LE RFRM-family
container, unrelated to the Wii RPAK: `PACK` v1 form → `TOCC` v3 with
`ADIR` (u32 count + 52-byte LE entries: FourCC, LE uuid, versions,
absolute offset, decompressed + stored sizes), `META` (uuid → blob)
and `STRG` (byteswapped-FourCC + uuid + name) chunks. Members are raw
RFRM resources, stored or LZSS mode 0-3 (u32 LE mode word, same group
math as the Tropical stream). Layout per PrimeDecomp/retrotool's
`pack.rs` (MIT/Apache-2.0, re-implemented) and verified byte-for-byte
against retrotool's own `pak extract` binary (built from source):
`GameplayOverrides.pak` (2 stored members) and `MiscData.pak`
(11 members incl. real LZSS SHNT/FONT) both extract identical trees.

New `lib-mpr-pak.c` (`ScanMPRPACK` — PACK/TOCC versions, per-entry
bounds + stored-entry inner-RFRM agreement, no decompression at scan
so big paks probe fast; `GetMPRPACKEntry` decompresses then
re-validates the inner RFRM; `BuildMPRPACKFoot` appends retrotool's
FOOT/AINF/META/NAME footer), `NFMT_MPR_PACK`, `extract_mpr_pack_file`
(`<name>.<TYPE>`, guid fallback, `..`-safe, parents created) hooked
after RPAK, `t_mpr_pack` with two committed retail fixtures
(`mpr_pack_gameplay_overrides.pak` 448 B, `mpr_pack_miscdata.pak`
62 KB). Repack direction not implemented.

**Next**: ~~MPR TXTR decode — TXTR form v47/51 + HEAD (`STextureHeader`:
kind/format/dims/layers/tile/swizzle/mips/sampler) with GPU bytes
assembled from FOOT-META buffer descriptors, detiled with the BNTX
Tegra block-linear path (`BntxDeswizzle`) and pixel-decoded via the
existing BCn/ASTC codecs (formats 20-29 BC1-5, 53-84 ASTC, 81-84
BC6H/BC7 per retrotool's `txtr.rs`). Real sample already in hand
(`MiscData.pak` TXTR: 232×232 R8Unorm).~~ DONE (2026-09-11, two
parallel sessions converged): `890f30c` implemented the decode in
`lib-retro-txtr.c` (`IsMPRTXTR`/`ScanMPRTXTR`/`DecodeMPRTXTR_RGBA`,
verified against real ASTC 5×5/8×5 + BC7 textures); a second pass
added `DetectNintendoFormat` RFRM-family resolution (Tropical →
PACK → MPR TXTR → UNKNOWN, `NFMT_MPR_TXTR`, so real TXTRs no longer
misreport as LZ10/LZ11 streams), a retail regression block
(232×232, black corner, full tonal range, no-LZ FILETYPE),
`T_mpr_pack` member counting minus derived PNGs plus a cascade-PNG
assert, the README row, and a direct-index META read shortcut. A
duplicate standalone `lib-mpr-txtr.c` from the second pass was
removed again in favour of the `lib-retro-txtr.c` home. Smash
Ultimate reverified same pass: NUMSHB (incl. v1.8 bbox paths)
green, NUTEXB/NUS3AUDIO unchanged,   `data.arc` retail correctly SKIP
(15 GB cart not local). CMDL models after that.

**Follow-up 2026-09-11 — MPR CMDL decode ✅.** New `lib-mpr-cmdl.c`
(`IsMPRCMDL`/`ScanMPRCMDL`/`ParseMPRCMDL` → `model_t` →
`ExportModelToGLB`): RFRM `CMDL` v114/125 chunk walk
(HEAD/MTRL/MESH/VBUF/IBUF/GPU + trailing FOOT/META), META dialect
with separate vtx/idx buffer tables, GPU buffers via `DecodeMPR_LZSS`
(mode-0 stored included), vertex components per retrotool's
`EVertexDataFormat`/`EVertexComponent` (float + half positions,
normals, UVs, colours), per-entry-relative buffer indices with a
sequential META cursor (confirmed on multi-entry files), positions
required finite and inside the HEAD AABB (bad meshes skipped, never
emitted). Two real bugs found by testing, not review: half-float
positions initially rejected (retail quantizes positions to Rgba16F),
and the MESH `has_lod_rules` field takes values {0,1,2} corpus-wide
(2 = no payload, 3 files — the reference also only reads rules for
exactly 1). Verified against all 687 retail CMDL members: 687/687
yield valid glTF (98/98 sampled pass `validate-glb.py`), incl. a
51-mesh scene byte-identical between `wmdlt DECODE` and `wszst xx`.
`NFMT_MPR_CMDL` registry entry (no new `FF`, RFRM-shared-magic
precedent), `extract_mpr_cmdl_file` + `wmdlt` fallback, `t_mpr_cmdl`
(unit-cube fixture + xx/wmdlt byte-agreement). SMDL skinning +
TXTR-uuid material resolution are phase 2.

**Follow-up 2026-09-11 — SMDL geometry + material names ✅.**
Skinned SMDL (v127/133, SKHD chunk) decodes unskinned through the
same path: 179/179 retail members yield valid glTF (bone transforms
live outside the files and no skeleton oracle exists anywhere
checked — not retrotool either — so weights export as future work,
asserted skinless in the test). MTRL material walk cracked against
all 866 files (names + shader/guid + type FourCCs + render types +
(id,type) pairs + (id,type,inner) triples incl. layered CPLX and
nil-conditional texture usage; 2167 names, 8592 TXTR uuids, exact
chunk-end every time) and names are exported + bound per-mesh
(verified: 51-mesh scene, prim→material 18, `ruins_..._mat12`).
`t_mpr_cmdl` extended (material-name/binding asserts, SMDL
fixture + skinless assert). Genuine walk bugs caught along the way:
a missing types-array skip, a (type,id) misread, and a pair check
that ignored inner sizes past t=0.

**Follow-up 2026-09-11 — SMDL skin validation.** SKHD word 1 is the
bone count, confirmed empirically across 30 spot-checked files
(max `BoneIndices` value == count-1 almost everywhere; `BoneWeights`
rows sum to 1.00): indices are uniformly u8x4, weights half-x4
(288/290 comps) or float-x4 (one file initially misread as corrupt
until the float form was recognized). The decoder parses and
validates both (indices < count, finite weights, row sums ≤ 1.1)
and skips meshes that fail, without exporting skins — no oracle
for bone transforms exists anywhere checked. Full 866-file
re-sweep after: 866/866 non-empty, 5034 meshes total, 51-mesh
reference scene intact. (The MESH u16 tail array is opaque —
~1.5-2x mesh count, values often above the bone count — so it is
skipped, not interpreted.)

**Follow-up 2026-09-11 — DIFT textures resolve.** MTRL `DIFT` uuids
(3/3 sampled match uuid-named TXTR members) are stored as
`<uuid>.TXTR.png` material texture names; CMDL export defers like
MOD/HSF so `export_models_tree()` converts with the tree-wide PNG
index ready, and a new `export_model_if_possible()` RFRM branch
covers the deferred pass. Verified: planted-UUID PNG embeds
byte-exact (`--require-images` valid, baseColorTexture bound).
`t_mpr_cmdl` extended; single-file runs still agree byte-exact
(both sides emit the same external URI when no PNG is around).

## 33. 2026-09-11 — "All of PLAN" sweep: closed what was closable, verified every block

Systematic pass over every open thread in this log:

- **DTLS Wii U extensionless `content/ls`** (gap left by `dfb3a6e`): fixed —
  name gate + sibling `dt00` resolution, 6541 members, test + docs.
- **DTLS 3DS variant** (new, found via the §3 ctrtool verification below):
  `of\x01\x00` + 12-byte entries, 4513 spans vs the real 781 MB `dt`,
  synthetic test + docs.
- **BNFM §12**: confirmed already fixed (§20); added the PAC→BNFM→GLB
  end-to-end lock-in test.
- **MPR CMDL** (§32 Next): implemented, 687/687 retail members to valid
  glTF, test + docs (see above).
- **§3 ctrtool**: verified on a real 2 GB Smash 3DS cart (exefs/romfs +
  media cascade). hactool was already proven (§29 F-Zero 99).
- **§6 HSF**: verified done (valid 1.5 MB GLB from the retail sample);
  only ATB left, no samples.
- **§5 FTXP**: verified closed by §26 (entry-internal decode present).

Verified still blocked (prerequisites checked, not assumed): G1T Wii U
(no Hyrule Warriors dump on disk), MDL0 palette pairing (no ACCF disc),
SFZDAT/CPK (no CPK tooling), Cafe BFFNT (no GPU oracle), BFSAR/BCSAR
(no samples), Switch FSEQ/coverage (§7/§29: Tomodachi + F-Zero 99
romfs trees contain zero sequence files), ATB (no samples).
SMDL skinning + MTRL/TXTR-uuid material resolution deliberately left
as CMDL phase 2 (samples exist: 179 SMDL + MTRL/TXTR members).

Full suite after the sweep: PASS=424 FAIL=0 SKIP=2 (both SKIP need
retail dumps not on disk). The run first showed 2 FAILs, both the
`t_camelot_texbank` cases — pre-existing breakage from `f899793`
(extractor gated to `.stpl`/`.camelot`, test still used extensionless
files), not from this session; test updated to the intended gate,
second full run green.

**Robustness fuzz 2026-09-11.** ~360 seeded truncation/mutation cases
through the new decoders, all clean (decline, never crash/hang):
CMDL truncations (17) + 3-byte mutations (120), SMDL mutations
(120), DTLS `ls` mutations (60), MPR PACK mutations (40, covering
PACK+TXTR+cascade+CMDL paths). 20/120 CMDL mutants still decode
(structurally valid survivors). No bugs found; no code changed.

## 34. 2026-09-11 — CRIWARE CPK + CRILAYLA (Star Fox Zero): §15 unblocked ✅

Pulled the retail WUX from mcubewiiu (6.6 GB) with the local title
key, extracted to tmp-sfzero (content/data000-003.cpk: 1.26 GB /
2.5 MB / 863 MB / 864 MB). Layout per esperknight/CriPakTools CPK.cs
(MIT, re-implemented) and proven byte-exact in Python first: `CPK `
packet + UTF header (TocOffset/ContentOffset/Files/Align), `TOC `
packet rows (DirName/FileName/FileSize/ExtractSize/FileOffset, offsets
rebased by min(Content,Toc)), CRILAYLA payloads (`usize + 0x100 ==
ExtractSize` on every sample checked). New `lib-cpk.c` (`ScanCPK` with
XOR-UTF support, `DecodeCRILAYLA` backwards bitstream, both
bounds-checked; malloc-owned entries sharing `write_owned_entries`),
`FF_CPK` registry, `extract_cpk_file`, `t_cpk` (synthetic stored +
real 880B CRILAYLA span fixtures). Verified: 705/705 retail members
extract with real names, zero skips; `face_fox.dat` C output is
byte-identical to the Python reference; the pre-existing SFZDAT
extractor cascades with no changes (shader.dat → 664 entries).
README SFZDAT row flipped to retail-verified, CPK row added. ITOC-only
layouts declined (none here); repack not implemented. Scratch WUX kept
at szs-retail-test/tmp-sfzero (11 GB) until the corpus is fully mined.

**Follow-up 2026-09-11 — WTA/WTP textures.** Same disc: 828 `\0BTW`
bundles (+698 `.wtp` payloads; 130 lonely indices decline cleanly).
Layout per RandomTBush's Bayo2-SF0-SFG_WTA-WTP.bms (re-implemented
field by field after catching two transcription slips — a `Gxx2`
typo and mis-split BLK words — via byte-identity against proven
decoder output): BE header (total + 5 table offsets), start/size
tables, members wrapped as Gfx2/GTX for the existing cascade.
New `ScanWTA` merged into the pre-existing `lib-wta.c` (whose PC-
style `ExtractWTAArchive` was found orphaned-but-working and left
intact — an early `write` clobber was caught and reverted before
commit), sibling-`.wtp` search (same-dir, then bounded parent
tree for the retail `wta/`+`wtp/` split), `FF_WTA` magic case,
`t_wta` (retail 128x128 pair fixture). Verified: 828 bundles →
2600 textures → 2600 PNGs, 100% cascade, sampled pixel-diverse.
README row added. WMB/MOT (627/897) mapped next, references located
(Kerilk Noesis plugin covers Star Fox Zero) but not started.

**Follow-up 2026-09-11 — WMB models.** New `lib-wmb.c`
(`IsPlatinumWMB`/`ParsePlatinumWMB` → `model_t`): `\0BMW` header, 7
verified (format, mapping, unkD) layouts, float positions, 10-10-10
normals (Bayo2 variant, 300/300 unit), half UVs, u16 indices (list +
strip→triangles), mesh names, `FF_WMB` + `wmdlt`/`xx` hooks,
`t_wmb` (fixture + winding-agreement assert). Verified: 627 files →
2903 meshes, 48/48 sampled valid. Three genuine bugs caught by
testing: batch-relative (not absolute) index base, degenerate-strip
stitch markers must be kept for the multiple-of-3 count, and stored
backward winding must flip (0/1618 → 1618/1618 face/normal
agreement). A transient xx/wmdlt mismatch during development
was proven to be a stale binary (md5-verified rebuilds from here on),
not a code bug.

**Follow-up 2026-09-11 — WMB skinning & materials.** Bone parent list + relative
positions decode to anonymous joints (`bone%03d`) with binds derived
via `ComputeModelTRSBinds`; per-batch remap applied to the validated
u8 weights (247k verts probed: zero zero-weight rows, so the rigid
fallback never fires on this corpus). Verified: 490/627 files
skinned (3707 joints), 2903 meshes intact, exported WEIGHTS_0 rows
sum to exactly 1.0; `t_wmb` asserts 1 joint + unit sums on a 1056B
fixture.

**Follow-up 2026-09-12 — WMB material mapping.** Analysis of the 627-file
corpus showed that batch `b+6` (u16) is the material index addressing
the material table defined at header 0x44 (num_materials), 0x48 (offsets),
0x4c (base address). Across all 3,116 batches in the 627 retail models,
`bmat < num_materials` holds with zero overruns. Materials decode shader
names from the 0x70 table, texture hashes from slot 1 (`mp+4`), and linear
diffuse RGBA from `mp+24..36`. Added retail multi-material fixture
`tests/fixtures/wmb_sfzero_bm0068.wmb` (2,976 B, 3 materials, 3 batches)
and expanded `t_wmb` to assert 3 materials mapped 1:1 to primitives.
Full suite: PASS=431 FAIL=0.

## 35. Retail Regression & Format Verification (3DS, Wii, Arcade, DS)

Systematic verification against retail images from the external SSD corpus
(`szs-retail-test/`):

- **GAR / ZAR (3DS)**: Verified against 3 retail RomFS corpora: SYSTEM variant
  (Luigi's Mansion 3DS, `GAR\x02`-`\x05`), queen variant (OoT3D, `ZAR\x01`), and
  jenkins variant (MM3D actor-info). Added retail fixtures (`event37.gar` 352 B,
  `zelda_mir_ray.zar` 3,836 B, `z2_kajiya_info.gar` 1,060 B) and regression
  tests `t_gar_lm3ds`, `t_zar_oot3d`, `t_gar_mm3d`.
- **SIR0 (DS)**: Verified against retail *Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of
  Sky* (USA) NDS ROM. Extracted `data/BALANCE/item_s_p.bin` (3,856 B), confirmed
  `FILETYPE` detection and subheader segment extraction. Added `t_sir0_ds_retail`.
- **BCSTM (3DS)**: Verified against retail *Yo-Kai Watch* (USA) 3DS RomFS.

## 36. Retail Regression & Format Verification Round 2 (MSR, NDS Banner, CNUT, COD PAK0, PTLG, Retro TXTR)

Extended verification against retail discs, RomFS, and cart dumps from `/Volumes/SSD/szs-retail-test/`:

- **MSR Package (`.pkg`) (3DS)**: Audited all 368 retail `.pkg` packages in
  *Metroid: Samus Returns* RomFS. Identified and resolved scanner discrepancy in
  `ScanMetroidSR()` (`lib-msr.c`): synthetic tests previously assumed strict unpadded
  equality `12 + files*12 == info_size` and `info_size + data_size == size`, whereas
  all 345 populated retail packages pad tables to 4-byte / block alignments and align
  entry offsets (so `table_end <= info_size + 4` and `(info_size + 4) + data_size == size`).
  Updated parser bounds checks; verified 345/345 retail packages extract cleanly. Added
  retail fixture `tests/fixtures/3ds_samples/msr/retail_s000_mainmenu_discardables.pkg`
  (1,036 bytes, 7 entries) and regression test `t_msr_3ds_retail`.

  `t_retro_txtr_retail_dkcr`.
- **SARC Archives (Wii U)**: Extracted retail `meta/Manual.bfma.d/BfmaInfo.arc` (2,204 bytes
  decompressed) from *Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival* (USA) WUX disc image. Confirmed
  `wszst FILETYPE` identifies `SARC`, `wszst EXTRACT` unpacks `blyt/BfmaInfo.bflyt`, and

## 38. 2026-09-12 — Retro Studios RPAK encoder (*Donkey Kong Country Returns*, Wii)

`ScanRPAK()`/`DecompressRPAKEntry()` (`project/src/lib-rpak.c`) only ever decoded this
format; no encoder existed for either RPAK or any of the codebase's other extract-only
Retro/Ganbarion-style containers (JARC, GPAK, etc.). Added `CreateRPAK()`, building a
fresh archive from a caller-supplied `rpak_entry_t` list: 0x80-byte header (`strg_length`
at 0x48, `rshd_length` at 0x50, `data_length` at 0x58, all else zero -- version/hash are
documented as unverified/not needed for extraction), an empty 4-byte STRG section (count
0), the RSHD entry table (24 bytes/entry: compressed flag, magic, id_hi/id_lo, stored
data_length, pointer), and the concatenated payload data. Per-entry payload is either
copied raw or CMPD-wrapped as a single zlib block (`deflateInit2` with a 15-bit window,
the same zlib-with-header form `DecompressRPAKEntry()` expects) with a raw-stored
fallback (block flag 0x00, stored_size==uncompressed_size) when zlib doesn't shrink the
data -- mirrors the mix of stored/compressed blocks real retail files carry side by side.

Not verified against a real retail file (no reverse-engineered value exists for the
version/hash header fields or a real STRG section to reproduce byte-exact), but verified
synthetically: encoded a 2-entry archive (one compressed, one raw) with `CreateRPAK()`
and round-tripped it byte-for-byte back through the real `ScanRPAK()`/
`DecompressRPAKEntry()` decoder logic (both entries recovered identical to the source
buffers). `project/src/lib-rpak.c` builds clean standalone; the full `wszst` binary link
was pre-broken by unrelated in-progress `ui-wszst`/`main.inc` changes already present in
the working tree before this change, so the isolated decode/encode round-trip above (a
plain-C copy of the exact `CreateRPAK`/`ScanRPAK`/`DecompressRPAKEntry` logic linked only
against zlib) stood in for it.
