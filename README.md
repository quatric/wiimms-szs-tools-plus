## Fork: native Nintendo/Brawl format support

This fork adds native (no external binaries, except where noted) support for
a range of Wii/DS/3DS/Wii U/Switch container, texture, model and crypto
formats beyond what upstream Wiimm's SZS Tools ships, plus a few tools
(`wajpg`, `wlzh8`, `wbmsx`, `wwc24crypt`, `wlayt`, `wmdlt`, `wbrsar`) folded
into `wszst`/`wimgt`. Builds with the normal `cd project && make all -j4` and
is exercised by `tests/regress.sh`.

Regression results have distinct meanings. Ordinary `PASS` entries may be
decoded-data, semantic, structural, or explicitly byte-exact checks as stated
in their labels. The separate `BYTE`/`BFAIL` totals are stricter canonical
encoder-determinism checks: identical logical input (including the same
resource basename) is encoded twice and the complete output files must match.
The separate `FIXED`/`FFAIL` totals are stricter again: a canonical file is
encoded, decoded through its public interchange representation, and re-encoded,
and both complete binary generations must match. This currently covers 94
image, Message Studio, layout, model, archive, compression, and disc-image
paths. These checks do not imply that rebuilding an arbitrary retail file keeps
its original padding, ordering, compression choices, or unknown fields.
The deterministic fixture run currently exercises 110 byte-equality checks
covering compression streams; flat and hierarchical archives; Nintendo
textures, fonts, layouts, messages and sequences; BRSAR/BCSAR/BFSAR/BRSTM/BFSTM/BCSTM;
HSF, MOD, MSH, MDL0 and both Wii U/Switch BFRES paths; the complete GTX
format/tile/mip/array/MSAA encoder matrix; and GSH program assembly. Retail
decode→encode identity is separately asserted where the textual form is
designed to retain every source field (currently conditional NCER, NANR,
BRLAN and BRLYT tests, plus GSH program bytes). Normalizing/lossy conversions
such as arbitrary retail HSF→DAE→HSF, palette normalization, image codec
transcoding, and MIDI conversion are deliberately tested semantically rather
than mislabeled byte-preserving.

Full verification detail — what each format was checked against, which real
samples were used, and what remains unverified — is in a
[companion gist](https://gist.github.com/quatric/144b2e005bfa1641b3d9d67ddc00151b)
rather than duplicated here.

### New features

- External pass-through extraction for containers with no native decoder —
  Wii/GC disc images, DS ROMs, CIA/3DS, Wii WADs, and Switch NSP/XCI/NCA are
  handed to `wit`/`ndstool`/`ctrtool`/`sharpii`/`hactool` and the unpacked
  tree is recursed into (`--no-passthrough` disables it).
- Wii U disc images (`.wud`/`.wux`) pass through to `wud2app`+`cdecrypt`
  (both required on PATH, plus a sibling `<name>.key` 16-byte title key next
  to the source). WUX is decompressed natively first (no external tool for
  that step); the disc is never read into RAM, so a 20+GB image extracts at
  the same fixed low memory cost as any other pass-through container.
- Recursive directory traversal and bottom-up incremental tree repacking:
  `wszst CREATE <wit-extracted-dir>` automatically detects modified assets (`.dae`, `.png`, `.yaml`, `.xml`, `.txt`) and child `.d` folders across the entire game hierarchy. It injects changed `.dae` models back into parent containers (`.brres`, `.bmd`, `.bch`, `.bcres`, `.bfres`, `.mdl0`), re-encodes textures and data, and rebuilds only the modified sub-archives (`.szs`, `.arc`, `.sarc`, `.narc`, `.darc`, `.pac`, `.gfa`, `.rarc`, `.bcsar`, `.bfsar`, `.rst`). Untouched sub-archives and files are skipped and preserved bit-for-bit.
- QuickBMS script chaining: `wszst xx --bms=<script.bms>` chains a QuickBMS
  script into `wszst xx` for unsupported containers, auto-staging and
  recursing into inner Nintendo assets.
- `wajpg`/`wlzh8`/`wbmsx`/`wwc24crypt`/`wlayt`/`wmdlt`/`wbrsar` folded into
  `wimgt`/`wszst` as first-class commands, no standalone binaries needed.
- `wszst xx` recurses into pass-through and SARC/PAC/GFA/DARC extraction
  output, auto-decoding textures, layouts, fonts, and models found inside.
- `CREATE`/`ENCODE` cache a SHA1 per member in a hidden `.wszst-cache.txt`
  next to `wszst-setup.txt`. A member whose current content still matches
  the cache is neither re-encoded (e.g. an untouched `.tpl.png`) nor does it
  force the archive to be reassembled and recompressed — only a real,
  content-level change pays that cost, and a fully unchanged directory
  leaves the destination file untouched instead of rewriting it byte-for-byte.

- Fixed Nintendo-format auto-detection (`DetectNintendoFormat`) and image
  loading (`wimgt DECODE`) for **WarioWare: D.I.Y. Showcase / "WarioWare
  Snapped!"** (DSiWare, NTR-KUWE). Every LZ11-compressed Nitro graphics
  resource it stores (NCGR/NCLR/NCER/NANR) is wrapped in an extra 4-byte
  little-endian size-prefix record *inside* the LZ11 stream, before the
  resource's own RGCN/RLCN/RECN/RNAN magic: byte 0 is always `0x00`, bytes
  1-2 are a `u16` LE holding `payload_size`, byte 3 is always `0x00`, and
  the real resource — magic and all — starts at offset 4. Confirmed against
  5 real assets pulled from the retail USA Rev1 ROM (`Style/StyleO.NCLR.bin`,
  `Style/Style_Head.NCGR.bin`, `Style/Style_Head.NCER.bin`,
  `Style/Style_2P_01.NANR.bin`, `Game/WarningB.NCLR.bin`): in every case
  bytes 1-2 as LE16 equalled `(decompressed size - 4)` exactly. Previously
  every one of these files reported as unrecognized (`?`) because detection
  only ever looked for the magic at offset 0. `DetectNintendoFormat` now
  recognizes the wrapped form directly; `LoadIMG`/`AssignIMG` auto-
  decompress LZ10/LZ11 Nitro graphics and peel off the wrapper before
  handing the payload to the existing NCGR/NCLR decoders (this also fixed a
  separate, unrelated pre-existing gap where LZ10/LZ11-compressed Nitro
  graphics were never auto-decompressed before decode at all). Verified
  end-to-end: a real `WarningO.NCGR.bin` from that ROM now decodes to a
  valid 128x160 PNG via `wimgt DECODE` where it previously hard-failed.
  One separate, still-open limitation found along the way and left
  untouched (out of scope for this fix): `DecodeNCLR_RGBA` rejects any
  `depth==3` (4bpp) palette with more than 16 total colour entries, but
  some real DSiWare NCLR files (e.g. `StyleO.NCLR.bin`, a 4-bank/64-colour
  character-customization palette) legitimately pack multiple 16-colour
  banks into one `depth==3` section — multi-bank palette support is a
  separate decoder enhancement, not part of this detection/wrapper fix.
- Fixed and validated **Monster Games RST/TOC + QuickLZ** container support
  (used by Excite Truck, ExciteBots: Trick Racing, NASCAR Heat) against a real
  retail disc. TOC entry offsets are relative to the uncompressed payload,
  not the outer RST header; creation and extraction now use that retail
  convention instead of a mutually compatible 128-byte absolute-offset bug.
- Added native decode of the Monster Games (Excite Truck / ExciteBots)
  asset formats found inside those RST/TOC archives: `.tex` GX textures and
  `.art`/`.img` GUI images (both -> PNG, see the ART/IMG and TEX table rows
  for how the pixel format is recovered without a stored format field),
  `.msh` structured PMsh collision resources (-> COLLADA DAE), and `.mod`
  (NDL3/NDL2 GX display-list models, geometry format read straight out of
  the embedded display list's VAT register writes and a brute-forced index byte width) -> GLB, plus
  encoding back to geometry-only NDL3 `.mod` from DAE/GLB (see the
  MOD row), validated
  on 135/135 real Excite Truck and 193/203 real ExciteBots samples (see the
  MOD row). `.tex`/`.art`/`.msh`/`.mod` all decode real retail samples
  correctly and are safe to use today.

See the [gist](https://gist.github.com/quatric/144b2e005bfa1641b3d9d67ddc00151b)
for the full history of what was fixed, how each format was verified, and
against which real samples — not duplicated here.

### Format & compression support

3D model export defaults to **GLB** (binary glTF, textures embedded in the
file) rather than COLLADA/DAE — `wszst XX`/`XEXPORT`/`wmdlt ENCODE` write
`.glb` unless `--dest` names a file that explicitly ends in `.dae`, in which
case DAE (with loose sibling PNGs, still supported for injection workflows)
is written instead. Notes below that say "encode via DAE `--parent`
injection" describe the injection path specifically, which still consumes a
`.dae`; the model-export *default* is GLB.

| Format | Category | Decode | Encode | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AJJPG / AJPG | Still image | ✅ | ✅ | GBA-era still image container |
| ASH0 | Compression | ✅ | ✅ | |
| AT7 | Archive/compression | ✅ | ✅ | Another Century's Episode / Koei Tecmo |
| BCFNT | Font | ✅ | ✅ | 3DS bitmap font; full pixel decode to PNG via `wimgt`/`wszst XX` (RGBA8 linear exact; I4/I8/IA4/IA8/RGB565 via GX tile path, correct for linear data), encode via `wimgt` |
| BCH | Model | ✅ | ✅ | 3DS CTR H3D, incl. geometry; encode via DAE `--parent` injection |
| BCLAN | Layout | ✅ | ✅ | 3DS layout animation; shares BCLYT's parser/encoder, same status |
| BCLIM | Texture | ✅ | ✅ | 3DS textures |
| BCLYT | Layout | ✅ | ✅ | 3DS layout; 1980/1980 real files decode AND byte-exact round-trip (decode→encode→decode) against a real cartridge dump |
| BCRES | Model | ✅ | ✅ | 3DS graphics container, incl. geometry; encode via DAE `--parent` injection |
| BCSAR | Audio archive | ✅ | ✅ | 3DS Sound Archive (CSAR); recursive member & wave archive extraction (`wszst xx`) and creation (`wszst CREATE`). See the BFSAR row -- `wbfsar` reads both |
| BCWAV | Audio track | ✅ | ✅ | 3DS Sound Wave; DSP-ADPCM, IMA-ADPCM, PCM16, PCM8 decoding to WAV via `wszst DECOMPRESS`; encoding/transcoding supported in sibling `mobipeg` (`cwav`/`bcwav`) |
| BCWAR | Audio archive | ✅ | ✅ | 3DS Sound Wave Archive (CWAR); unpacks member BCWAV audio tracks and repacks (`wszst CREATE`) |
| ART / IMG | Texture | ✅ | 🟡 | Excite Truck / ExciteBots (Wii) GUI images; both the older raw-GX/zero-footer layout (dimensions and format recovered via tile-seam continuity) and ExciteBots' explicit 128-byte header layout, including I4/IA4 resources with auxiliary renderer tails and multi-level images. Colour+stencil pairs are recombined into proper RGBA. Encode (`wimgt CONVERT` → `.art`/`.img`) writes the older layout and self-verifies through the real classifier. Together with TEX, all 3,374 ART/IMG/TEX files in the available ExciteBots retail corpus decode successfully; headered I4/IA4 dispatch has dedicated synthetic regression coverage |
| BCGRP | Audio archive | ✅ | ✅ | 3DS Sound Group Archive (CGRP); unpacks embedded audio files and repacks (`wszst CREATE`) |
| BFFNT | Font | ✅ | ✅ | Wii U bitmap font; full pixel decode to PNG via `wimgt`/`wszst XX` (RGBA8 linear exact; I4/I8/IA4/IA8/RGB565 via GX tile path, correct for linear data), encode via `wimgt` |
| BFLAN | Layout | ✅ | ✅ | Wii U layout animation; lossless semantic text roundtrip via `wlayt`, verified on 1,148/1,148 retail files |
| BFLIM | Texture | ✅ | ✅ | Wii U textures, incl. BC1/BC2/BC3/BC4/BC5 block-compressed formats (fmt 14-17, 21-23) |
| BFLYT | Layout | ✅ | ✅ | Wii U layout; platform-specific material, pane, text, parts, group and container structures; lossless semantic text roundtrip via `wlayt`, verified on 251/251 retail files |
| BFRES | Model | 🟢 | ⛔ | Switch; geometry decode (position/normal/UV, first LOD mesh) to DAE verified against real Super Mario Odyssey retail data (v8+v9); falls back to the names/shapes/materials-only structure XML for the rare shape it can't decode yet |
| BFRES | Model | ✅ | ✅ | Wii U; encode via DAE `--parent` injection; FMAT materials bound to their first FTEX texture ref, decoded+PNG'd during extraction (98.8% of a real disc's models resolve a diffuse texture) |
| BFSAR | Audio archive | ✅ | ✅ | Wii U / Switch Sound Archive (FSAR); recursive member & wave archive extraction (`wszst xx`) and creation (`wszst CREATE`). Separately, `wbfsar` reads the archive's own real internal directory (STRG name lookup + INFO's Sound/Bank/Player/WaveArchive/SoundGroup/Group/File tables) and dumps every entry's index/Id/name as XML -- verified against a real retail 48 MB Wii U file (2323 real sound names resolved correctly); per-entry internal fields (a sound's player/volume/stream-vs-sequence-vs-wave detail, a bank's instrument tree) aren't decoded yet, see lib-bfsar.h. Same container generation covers 3DS BCSAR (CSAR magic, `wbfsar` handles both) |
| BFWAV | Audio track | ✅ | ✅ | Wii U / Switch Sound Wave; DSP-ADPCM, IMA-ADPCM, PCM16, PCM8 decoding to WAV via `wszst DECOMPRESS`; encoding/transcoding supported in sibling `mobipeg` (`fwav`/`bfwav`) |
| BFWAR | Audio archive | ✅ | ✅ | Wii U / Switch Sound Wave Archive (FWAR); unpacks member BFWAV audio tracks and repacks (`wszst CREATE`) |
| RWAV | Audio track | ✅ | ✅ | Wii Sound Wave (the individual sample RWAR wave archives and RBNK instrument banks reference); DSP-ADPCM and PCM16/PCM8 decoding via `wszst DECOMPRESS`; encoding/transcoding supported in sibling `mobipeg` (`rwav`/`brwav`) |
| RBNK | Instrument bank | 🟡 | ⛔ | Wii instrument bank (what an RSEQ program-change selects); full program → note-range (RangeTable/IndexTable) → InstParam (wave index, ADSR, pitch/volume/pan) lookup tree, plus embedded WaveInfo metadata, dumped as lossless-structure XML via `wrbnk`; verified against 9 real retail banks. Version ≥ 2 banks (waves referenced via an embedded RWAR instead of a direct WaveInfo list) parse the program tree but skip wave metadata -- no real ≥ 2 sample to verify that convention against yet. Decode only; no encoder |
| BFGRP | Audio archive | ✅ | ✅ | Wii U / Switch Sound Group Archive (FGRP); unpacks embedded audio files and repacks (`wszst CREATE`) |
| BRSTM / BFSTM / BCSTM | Audio stream | ✅ | ✅ | Wii/Wii U/3DS sound stream (`wbrstm`); DSP-ADPCM (`adpcm_thp`) and PCM16 to/from WAV. Encoding (`from_wav`) prefers passing straight through to the sibling 'mobipeg' repo's real `adpcm_thp` encoder over this project's own port, falling back to the port when mobipeg isn't installed or predates the brstm/dsp/bns muxers |
| BLZ | Compression | ✅ | ✅ | DS ARM9/ARM7/overlay compression |
| BMD (Early DS) | Model | ✅ | ✅ | Super Mario 64 DS / early Nitro 3D models; geometry decode to DAE & encode via DAE `--parent` injection |
| BMS | Interpreter | ✅ | 🟡 | QuickBMS interpreter (`wbmsx` + `wszst xx --bms`); native codec aliases only |
| BNTX | Texture | ✅ | ✅ | Switch textures; RGBA8/565/5551/4 + BC1-7 (incl. BC6H) + every standard 2D ASTC block footprint decode (validated against K0lb3/texture2ddecoder conformance vectors), RGBA8 encode |
| BREFT | Texture | ✅ | ✅ | Brawl effect texture, palette-indexed; encode via `wszst CREATE --breft`, `wimgt --btimg` |
| BRFNA | Font | ✅ | ✅ | Wii font archive, RFNA; encode via `wimgt ENCODE .brfna` |
| BRFNT | Font | ✅ | ✅ | Wii bitmap font; encode via `wimgt ENCODE .brfnt` |
| BRLAN | Layout | ✅ | ✅ | Wii layout animation; lossless text roundtrip via `wlayt` |
| BRLYT | Layout | ✅ | ✅ | Wii layout; lossless text roundtrip via `wlayt` |
| BRRES MDL0 | Model | ✅ | ✅ | Wii models → COLLADA; encode via DAE `--parent` injection |
| BRRES TEX0 | Texture | ✅ | ✅ | Wii textures; encode via `wimgt`; palette-indexed decode pairs sibling PLT0 data |
| BRSAR | Audio | ✅ | ✅ | → MIDI+SF2, plus `wbrsar pack` (dir of RSEQ/RBNK/RWAR/RWSD → .brsar/.bfsar/.bcsar) and `wbrsar unpack` (any variant back to individual assets) |
| BYAML | Data | ✅ | ✅ | binary YAML; encode via `wszst CREATE .byml` |
| BYML | Data | ✅ | ✅ | binary YAML; encode via `wszst CREATE .byml` |
| CCF | Archive | ✅ | ✅ | Wii/Switch Virtual Console archive, optional zlib compression; create via `wszst CREATE .ccf` |
| CGFX | Model | ✅ | ✅ | 3DS graphics container, incl. geometry; encode via DAE `--parent` injection |
| CTPK | Texture / Archive | ✅ | ✅ | 3DS multi-texture container; encode via `wimgt` or folder create via `wszst CREATE .ctpk` |
| DARC | Archive | ✅ | ✅ | 3DS "differential archive" container |
| Deflate | Compression | ✅ | ✅ | via BMS & wszst; encode via `wszst COMPRESS --dest .deflate` |
| GFA | Archive | ✅ | ✅ | "GFAC" archive; create via `wszst CREATE .gfa` |
| GTX | Texture | ✅ | ✅ | Wii U GX2 "Gfx2" texture container. Lossless bounds-checked parsing and raw-element encoding cover the complete public `GX2SurfaceFormat` storage matrix, explicit mip levels, array/cube/3D slices, MSAA samples, component selectors, depth/stencil surfaces, tile modes 0-15, thick tiles, bank swaps, and pipe/bank/slice/sample rotation. RGBA visualization covers UNORM/UINT/SNORM/SINT/FLOAT/SRGB channel formats, packed RGB/RGBA and depth formats, plus BC1-5 (including signed BC4/BC5); ordinary RGBA input and caller-supplied compressed/raw elements can be tiled back into GTX. Dedicated regressions exercise all public formats, every tile mode, mipmaps, arrays and 4x MSAA. |
| GSH | Shader | ✅ | 🟡 | Shader-only Wii U Gfx2 container; lossless bounds-checked blocks, relocation/string-table metadata, vertex/pixel/geometry/compute header↔program associations, and unknown blocks retained. `wszst EXTRACT file.gsh` emits named Latte listings only after reassembly proves complete program-byte equality; 12 programs across five real Nintendo Land containers pass, plus a deterministic semantic assembler test. Known instructions receive Decaf semantic ALU/TEX/VTX/CF output and unsupported encodings retain lossless RAW words. Rebuilding/editing a complete GSH container and high-level GLSL compilation remain outside the current encoder; CafeGLSL can be used for GLSL compilation |
| HSF (HSFV037) | Model | ✅ | 🟡 | Hudson model (Mario Party 4-8 `.hsf`, extracted from MPBIN; a different, unrelated format from HAL's own "sysdolphin" HSD below despite the similar nickname); exports geometry (including vertex colors, float/packed normals, UVs, triangles/quads/indexed strips), hierarchy, CENV skinning/inverse binds, per-primitive materials, GX textures/palettes, recursively nested replica mesh subtrees (shared geometry, cycle guards, material splits, and composed transforms), shape and partial-vertex cluster morph targets, exact type-2 successive-lerp cluster coefficients, native perspective cameras, `KHR_lights_punctual` lights, and native 60 Hz glTF TRS/morph animations (step/linear/Bézier/constant HSF curves) to GLB; DAE receives the static model. Lossless sidecars retain motions, replicas, camera/light parameters, fog scenes, map attributes, matrix tables, parts, clusters, and shapes, including metadata-only HSF files. `wmdlt ENCODE model.dae --dest model.hsf` writes big-endian HSFV037 geometry, normals, UVs, vertex colors, triangle material assignments, materials, joint/object hierarchy, material attribute/symbol chains, and PNG layers converted to native GX RGBA8 textures. The model API additionally emits shape/cluster morphs, replicas, cameras/lights, whole/single/multi-weight CENV envelopes, and sampled TRS/morph motion tracks. Encode regression now compares mesh topology and POSITION bounds/counts, not merely magic and mesh count. Indexed palettes are normalized to RGBA8 and sidecar-only runtime metadata is not reconstructed from DAE, so encoding remains partial. Validated on MP4 Mario and 7,284 MP7 retail HSFs |
| HSD (sysdolphin `.dat`) | Model/Texture | 🟡 | ⛔ | HAL Laboratory's serialized-object-graph format (Super Smash Bros. Melee, Kirby Air Ride, Wii's "TV no Tomo" channel), identified structurally because it has no magic. Exports `HSD_Image`/`HSD_Tlut` textures and walks JOBJ/DOBJ/POBJ trees, decoding each GX display list's real per-attribute DIRECT/INDEX8/INDEX16 layout to GLB. Two-pass skeleton discovery resolves SingleBoundJOBJ and envelope-weighted meshes; MOBJ material colours/textures are bound, and playable-character root indirection is supported (fixture coverage includes Mario, Pikachu, Nana, Falco, Kirby, Luigi, Samus and Young Link). In the Melee item/object corpus, 346/352 `Ty*.dat` files produce glTF-validated geometry (9,564 meshes); the other six are non-model data/light/menu resources, while eight meshes in three UI objects retain implausible-coordinate edge cases. Animation/shape-animation export and a graph serializer remain unimplemented; no encoder |
| Huffman 0x24 | Compression | ✅ | ✅ | 4-bit nibble |
| Huffman 0x28 | Compression | ✅ | ✅ | 8-bit byte |
| Mario Party `.bin` | Archive | ✅ | ✅ | MPBIN container, games 4-8; unpacks & repacks via `wszst CREATE .bin` |
| MOD (NDL3/NDL2) | Model | ✅ | ✅ | Monster Games Excite Truck / ExciteBots (Wii) `.mod` 3D model; geometry format (position/UV element count, numeric format, fixed-point shift, index width) is read directly out of the embedded GX display list's vertex-attribute-table register writes rather than hardcoded, so it decodes the general case, not one fixed shape -> GLB (or COLLADA DAE with `--dest *.dae`); validated on 135/135 real Excite Truck and 193/203 real ExciteBots samples (the gap is exactly the separate .msh collision-mesh files, not .mod failures). Encoder: DAE/GLB -> `.mod` via `wmdlt ENCODE --dest *.mod` (plus sibling-DAE repack), emitting geometry-only NDL3 (`3LDN`) files with f32 big-endian positions, s16 shift-13 texcoords and GX TRIANGLES display lists (index width auto-sized; caps at 255 unique positions/texcoords since the tuple indices are bytes); round-trips all bundled fixtures through encode+decode twice with geometry preserved up to s16 UV quantization |
| MSH (PMsh) | Model | ✅ | ✅ | Monster Games Excite Truck / ExciteBots (Wii) collision resource: little-endian bucket, indexed-position, triangle-normal and collision-plane records -> COLLADA DAE; layout recovered from the retail game loader/raycast code and validated on all 7 real ExciteBots samples, including `gpmesh.msh` and `rail2bp.msh`. Encoder: DAE/GLB -> `.msh` via `wmdlt ENCODE --dest *.msh` (plus sibling-DAE repack); recomputes face plane + inward edge normals with the formulas reverse-engineered from the retail records (matches stored floats to float32 precision) and emits <=16-triangle buckets with exact bbox spheres -- retail bucket spheres vary between exporter runs, so buckets are rebuilt rather than byte-copied |
| MSBF | Text/flow | ✅ | ✅ | Nintendo Message Studio Binary Flow; decode & encode via `wbmgt` & `wszst` |
| MSBP | Text/flow | ✅ | ✅ | Nintendo Message Studio Binary Project; decode & encode via `wbmgt` & `wszst` |
| MSBT | Text/flow | ✅ | ✅ | Nintendo Message Studio Binary Text; decode & encode via `wbmgt` & `wszst` |
| NANR | Sprite | ✅ | ✅ | DS sprite; XML via `wszst CREATE` |
| NARC | Archive | ✅ | ✅ | Nitro Archive, DS/3DS container; create via `wszst CREATE .narc` |
| NCER | Sprite | ✅ | ✅ | DS sprite; XML via `wszst CREATE` |
| NCGR | Sprite | ✅ | ✅ | DS sprite; via `wimgt` |
| NCLR | Sprite | ✅ | ✅ | DS sprite; via `wimgt` |
| NCCARC | Archive | ✅ | ✅ | WarioWare: Touched! (DS) flat blob container; unpacks member chunks and repacks via `wszst CREATE .nccarc` |
| NSBMD | Model | ✅ | ✅ | DS models, incl. bone hierarchy; encode via DAE `--parent` injection |
| ODH | Still image | ✅ | ✅ | GBA-era still image codec |
| PAC | Archive | ✅ | ✅ | Brawl "ARC\0" archive; create via `wszst CREATE .pac` |
| PLT0 | Animation | ✅ | ✅ | Brawl G3D palette-swap animation; IA8, RGB565, RGB5A3 encode via `wimgt` |
| PSDK | Unknown | 🔍 | ⛔ | detected, not decoded |
| QuickLZ | Compression | ✅ | ✅ | both stream versions (1.20, 1.4.0) |
| RARC | Archive | ✅ | ✅ | GameCube / Wii object archive; create via `wszst CREATE .rarc` |
| romc | Compression | ✅ | ✅ | N64 Virtual Console ROM compression; type-1 LZ77 decode verified on Kirby 64 and deterministic literal-stream encode with 4 MiB-unit validation and round-trip coverage. Not every N64 VC title uses it (Yoshi's Story stores its ROM raw); the distinct type-2 `romchu` Huffman variant remains unavailable for lack of a retail sample |
| RL | Compression | ✅ | ✅ | |
| SARC | Archive | ✅ | ✅ | Nintendo "SARC" (Sorted ARChive); extract, inject, create via `wszst`; widely used in Switch titles |
| RNC1 | Compression | ✅ | ✅ | deterministic ProPack-compatible method-1 encoder; independently decoded by `propack` regression vectors |
| RNC2 | Compression | ✅ | ✅ | encode via `wszst COMPRESS --dest .rnc` |
| RSEQ | Sequence | ✅ | ✅ | Wii Revolution Sequence (.rseq/.brseq); MML disassembly, assembly, MIDI conversion (`wseqt` & `wszst`) |
| CSEQ | Sequence | ✅ | ✅ | 3DS CTR Sequence (.cseq/.bcseq); MML disassembly, assembly, MIDI conversion (`wseqt` & `wszst`) |
| FSEQ | Sequence | ✅ | ✅ | Wii U & Switch Format Sequence (.fseq/.bfseq); MML disassembly, assembly, MIDI conversion (`wseqt` & `wszst`) |
| SSEQ | Sequence | ✅ | ✅ | Nintendo DS Nitro Sequence (.sseq); MML disassembly, assembly, MIDI conversion (`wseqt` & `wszst`) |
| SDAT | Audio archive | ✅ | ⛔ | Nintendo DS Sound Archive; MIDI + SoundFont SF2 extraction via `wbrsar` |
| TEX | Texture | ✅ | 🟡 | Excite Truck / ExciteBots (Wii) GX texture; supports both the older footer/header-less layout (format recovered from mip consistency) and ExciteBots' explicit 128-byte header layout, including I4/IA4 auxiliary-tail resources that can otherwise collide with OBFLOW detection. Encode (`wimgt CONVERT` → `.etex`, rename to `.tex`) writes the older layout and self-verifies through the decoder. Together with ART/IMG, all 3,374 files in the available ExciteBots retail corpus decode successfully; encoding of the later explicit-header variant remains future work |
| WARC | Archive | ✅ | ✅ | Game & Wario (Wii U) flat archive; big-endian, uncompressed, unrelated to Excite's TOC/RES despite the naming coincidence; extraction layout ported from aluigi's `game_wario.bms`, with native folder creation and create→extract regression coverage |
| WC24 crypto | Crypto | ✅ | ✅ | `wwc24crypt` |
| WUD | Disc image | ✅ | ✅ | Wii U disc image; pass-through via `wud2app`+`cdecrypt` |
| WUX | Disc image | ✅ | ✅ | Wii U disc image, compressed; native WUX compress & decompress |
| Yay0 | Compression | ✅ | ✅ | |
| Zlib | Compression | ✅ | ✅ | via BMS & wszst; encode via `wszst COMPRESS --dest .zlib` |

### Formats WSZST supports officially (stock, upstream)

The table above covers this fork's own additions. Everything below is the
format list stock/upstream `wszst` already ships (`wszst FILETYPE`), listed
here for comparison. Status is read directly from each format's
`ff_attrib_t` flags in `src/file-type.c` (`FFT_DECODE`/`FFT_EXTRACT`/
`FFT_COMPRESS` → Decode, `FFT_ENCODE`/`FFT_CREATE`/`FFT_COMPRESS` → Encode).
