### Archives & Containers

| Format | Extensions | Decode Tested | Encode Tested | Byte-Exact Roundtrip | Retail Source Tested | Middleware / Engine / Platform Context |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ABE BigFile** | `.bf` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Ubisoft *Rabbids Go Home* BigFile archive (ABE\0 with segmented LZO1X chunks). Verified against the retail RGH.BF (~1 GiB, 8710 members): the magic check, the 200-byte entry stride, and the LZO1X M2/M3 distance decode were all wrong before this pass and are now byte-exact against liblzo2 |
| **ALAR** | `.alar` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Nintendo DS Nitro ALAR archive (*Jump Ultimate Stars*). `FF_ALAR` carries `FFT_ARCHIVE` but `GetIteratorFunction` has no entry for it, so the generic member iterator silently walked zero files for every real `.aar` on the cart, both sub-formats (a correction of an earlier pass in this same file, which mistook a whole-cart file-extension count for a successful per-archive extraction). Reverse-engineered and implemented a dedicated reader for both: type 2 (one raw blob, offset/size as plain LE32) and type 3 (a name/offset table -- see the extractor's own comment for the layout). Verified against the retail cart: `info.aar` (type 3) recovers 3 of 4 named members intact -- including one that itself cascades into a nested ALAR -- and `chr/*.aar` (type 2, the majority of the game's character data) now recovers its one member instead of nothing |
| **And-Kensaku** | `.rz` | ✅ | — | — | — | CyberConnect2 "Pres" archive, whole-stream Nintendo LZ77 (type 0x10/0x11) wrapped (Nintendo DS *Kanji Sonomama Rakubiki Jiten* / *And-Kensaku* family). Ported from Luigi Auriemma's `and_kensaku.bms`; verified byte-exact on synthetic LZ10 and LZ11 fixtures |
| **APAK** | `.apak` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Nintendo / Pokémon APAK archive format (Wii U / Switch) |
| **ARC0** | `.fa` | 🟡 | — | — | 🟡 | Level-5 flat archive (*Yo-Kai Watch*, 3DS). The outer `ARC0` index (header offsets 22360/28244, neither a clean stride through anything found so far) isn't understood; what's implemented instead scans for concatenated XPCK sub-archives by their own magic and measures each one from its own file table. Verified against the retail `yw1_a.fa` (386 MB): recovers 4087 real XPCK archives / 182,649 files intact. Marked partial because this only recovers XPCK members -- anything else the outer index might also hold is still unreachable |
| **ARC / U8** | `.arc`, `.szs` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Nintendo standard U8 archive (Wii / GameCube NintendoWare & EAD) |
| **ARCV** | `.arc` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Namco / Tose Wii archive format |
| **Arika Archive** | `INFO.DAT`, `GAME.DAT`, `.arika` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Arika DS / DSi / Wii archive system |
| **AT7** | `.at7` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Koei Tecmo container format (Wii / PS2) |
| **BG4** | `.bg4` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | AlphaDream 3DS flat archive with BLZ member compression |
| **BIGF** | `.big` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Electronic Arts Wii asset archive |
| **BNS Archive** | `.bns` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Koei Tecmo *Samurai Warriors 3* multi-file asset archive (`LINKDATA*.BNS`). Verified against the retail LINKDATA.BNS (~1.5 GiB): all 6022 members extract intact |
| **CA01 / SA01** | `.ca01`, `.sa01` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Nintendo Network Mii & amiibo system archive (3DS / Wii U) |
| **CCF** | `.ccf` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Nintendo Virtual Console container (Wii / Switch) |
| **CNUT** | `.cnut` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | *Wii Party* compiled Squirrel script & message container (`SQIR`). Verified against retail *Wii Party* (Wii) WBFS disc: `digits.cnut` (2,350 bytes) extracts script. Fixture: `tests/fixtures/wii_retail/retail_digits.cnut` |
| **COD PAK0** | `.pak` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | *Call of Duty: Black Ops* / *MW3* (Wii) sound archive (`PAK0`). Verified against retail *Call of Duty: Black Ops* (Wii) WBFS disc: extracts members including `retail_int_escape_0x1e78d28c.dsp` audio stream. Fixture: `tests/fixtures/wii_retail/retail_int_escape.pak` (4,096 bytes) |
| **CRAM** | `.arc`, `.cram` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Monolith Soft 3DS flat archive container |
| **DARC** | `.darc` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | NintendoWare NW4C differential archive (3DS) |
| **DTLS** | `dt00`, `ls00`, `.ls` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Bandai Namco composite package & lookup archive (*Super Smash Bros. 4* Wii U / 3DS). The retail Wii U `content/ls` uses a fourth layout next to the three 24-byte-entry forms: 4-byte tag `"of\x02\x00"` + LE `u32` count + 6541 16-byte LE entries (hash, dt-file offset, span size, a two-u16 trailer whose low bit tracks with compressed sizes and whose high word is 0/2/4 — semantics unconfirmed without `dt00`). `ScanDTLS()` decodes it (entries without a stored decompressed size pass through as raw `dt00` slices; some are genuine zlib streams inflating to real `NUS3`/`VAT\0`/`SQB\0`/`NTP3` content) and `wszst xx` accepts the extensionless retail `content/ls` name, resolving `content/dt00` beside it (6541 members even with `dt00` absent). The 3DS side ships the same idea smaller: `of\x01\x00` tag + 12-byte entries (hash, offset, span size), verified against the retail cart's real `romfs/ls` (4513 entries, all in-bounds) + `romfs/dt` (781 MB) pair — spans open with alignment padding and pack concatenated zlib streams (plus all-CC alignment sentinels), extracted raw; `wszst xx` resolves sibling `dt` when no `dt00` exists. |
| **F9RES** | `.res` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | GameCube resource archive container |
| **FSYS** | `.fsys` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Genius Sonority archive system (GameCube / Wii) |
| **GAR / ZAR** | `.zar`, `.gar` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Grezzo Zelda & Luigi's Mansion archive (*OoT3D*, *MM3D*, *LM3DS*). Verified against three retail RomFS corpora: **SYSTEM** variant (Luigi's Mansion 3DS, `GAR\x02`-`\x05` magic, 0x20-byte group stride) — 58 `.gar` files, extracts `.cmb`, `.cmab`, `.csab`, `.ctxb`, `.bas` members; **queen** variant (OoT3D, `ZAR\x01`) — hundreds of `.zar` files, extracts `.cmb` models; **jenkins** variant (MM3D, `.gar` actor-info) — scene/actor containers, extracts `.cmab`+`.csab` animation pairs. Fixtures: `tests/fixtures/3ds_samples/lm_gar/event37.gar` (352 B, SYSTEM), `tests/fixtures/3ds_samples/oot_zar/zelda_mir_ray.zar` (3,836 B, queen), `tests/fixtures/3ds_samples/mm3d_gar/z2_kajiya_info.gar` (1,060 B, jenkins) |
| **GFA** | `.gfa` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Good-Feel GFAC container (Wii / 3DS / Wii U). Also verified against the retail *Yoshi's Woolly World* (Wii U): `content/message_image/msgbox008_00k.gfa` (148,877 bytes) extracts to a 2-member SARC that cascades into a real BFLIM texture and BFLYT layout. Committed as `tests/fixtures/gfa_wiiu_yoshis_woolly_world_msgbox008_00k.gfa` |
| **Hyrule Warriors** | `.idx`, `.bin` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Koei Tecmo / Omega Force split index archive (3DS) |
| **IQIPACK** | `.pak` | ✅ | — | — | — | NVIDIA Shield iQiyi PAK archive with XXTEA encryption |
| **JARC** | `.jarc` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Level-5 DS archive container (DS) |
| **LSPK** | `.pk`, `.pkh`, `.lspk` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Level-5 / Mistwalker flat package (*The Last Story*). Verified against the retail `levels.pk`/`.pkh` pair (2626 members). Unrelated to the DS *Inazuma Eleven*'s own `.pkh`/`.pkb` files, which open with a `PackNum` text header this format doesn't expect and are still unrecognized (see the G4PKM row) |
| **MDR** | `.mdr` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | *Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix* chunk archive with per-chunk zlib streams |
| **MKGPDX PAC** | `.pac`, `.mkgpdx` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | *Mario Kart Arcade GP DX* layout archive (`pack`). Verified against the retail arcade image: `Data/flash/data_jp/bun_bg/bun_bg.pac` (12,501 bytes) extracts 5 layout members (`SW_BUN_BG`, `BUN_BG_01`, `BUN_BG_02`, `BUN_BG_MAP`, `ROOT_BUN_BG`). Repacked with `wszst create ... --dest *.mkgpdx` and re-extracted content-identical. Committed as `tests/fixtures/arcade_samples/mkgpdx_bun_bg.pac` |
| **MPBIN** | `.bin` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Hudson Soft Mario Party archive container (GameCube / Wii) |
| **MPR PACK** | `.pak` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Retro Studios asset container (*Metroid Prime Remastered*, Switch). LE RFRM form (`PACK` v1) with a `TOCC` v3 directory: 52-byte ADIR entries (FourCC type, LE uuid, absolute offset, declared + stored sizes), META blobs and STRG names. Members are raw RFRM resources, stored or LZSS-compressed (u32 LE mode 0-3). Verified against the retail romfs: `Preload/MPR1/GameplayOverrides.pak` (2 stored members) and `MiscData.pak` (11 members incl. LZSS-compressed SHNT/FONT and a TXTR) extract byte-identical to retrotool's own `pak extract`, as `<STRG name>.<TYPE>` with the FOOT form appended. `wszst xx` recurses into members; repack (`pak package` direction) is not implemented |
| **MSR** | `.pkg`, `.bin` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | *Metroid: Samus Returns* (3DS) flat archive container (`.pkg`). Verified against retail *Metroid: Samus Returns* (USA) 3DS RomFS: all 345 populated `.pkg` packages extract intact across levels and maps, handling header/table padding and 32/128-byte aligned offsets. Fixture: `tests/fixtures/3ds_samples/msr/retail_s000_mainmenu_discardables.pkg` (1,036 bytes, 7 members) |
| **MTXT** | `.mtxt` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Nintendo Switch MTXT texture archive (gzip-wrapped XTX). Note: 3DS `.bctex` files also carry `MTXT` magic but use a different raw-pixel format (see MSR row); not supported |
| **NARC** | `.narc` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Nintendo DS Nitro standard archive (DS / DSi) |
| **NCCARC** | `.nccarc` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Nintendo DS flat blob container |
| **NDS / SRL / DSI** | `.nds`, `.srl`, `.dsi` | ✅ | — | — | — | Nintendo DS & DSi ROM images and executables |
| **NXARC** | `.nxarc` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Nintendo Switch NX archive (`RAXN`) |
| **PAC (Nd Cube)** | `.bin` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Nd Cube Wii U flat container (`PAC\0`, *Mario Party 10* / *Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival*). Every model/texture on the amiibo Festival retail disc ships packed inside this container. Members are ordinary zlib-compressed data (0x78 0xda header) -- not encrypted, and not even raw/headerless deflate, contrary to a prior pass's conclusion. Verified against the retail disc's `content/common/bin/ch_base/chara/cat/cat00.bin` (20/20 members decode to their exact declared size, including real GX2 `Gfx2` textures and the `cat00.bnfm` model -- see the BNFM row above). Unrelated to the "PAC / MRG" row below, which is a different format sharing only the `.pac` extension, not this one's `PAC\0` magic |
| **PAC / MRG** | `.pac`, `.mrg` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | HAL Laboratory / Game Arts Wii archive container |
| **PKG / GPKG / GPAK** | `.pkg`, `.pak`, `.gpak` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Gorilla Games *Bonsai Barber* PKG, 2D Boy *World of Goo* GPAK, and Sonic Team Storybook archive (*Secret Rings* / *Black Knight*). Verified against retail WiiWare images: *Bonsai Barber* `00000006.app`'s `bb_text.pkg` (237,568 bytes, zlib stream with 0x14 header + 0x28 entry records) extracts 97 files cleanly and round-trips via `wszst create` byte-for-byte; *World of Goo* `00000002.app`'s `master.pak` (37 MB GPAK) extracts 1731 files. Fixture committed as `tests/fixtures/wii_retail/bonsai_barber_bb_text.pkg` |
| **PKZ** | `.pkz` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | PlatinumGames archive format (*Bayonetta*, *Astral Chain*) |
| **PRC** | `.prc` | ✅ | — | — | — | *Super Smash Bros. 4* parameter binary (`para`) |
| **PVOL** | `.pvol` | 🟡 | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | *Pikmin 1 & 2* model & resource container archive. The retail carts ship this content as `dataDir/archives/*.arc` (e.g. `water.arc`), not `.pvol` -- the extractor's `is_ext_match(arg,".pvol")` gate never matches, and the real header (BE32 count, then named length-prefixed entries: `objects/water/motion`, `wait.dca`, ...) doesn't match the LE32 offset-table layout `ExtractPVOLArchive` assumes either, so no sample in this corpus decodes |
| **RARC** | `.rarc`, `.arc` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Nintendo standard resource archive (GameCube / Wii) |
| **RFL_Res** | `RFL_Res.dat`, `.dat` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Revolution Face Library Mii resource database (Wii / 3DS / Wii U). Verified against retail *Wii Party* (USA) disc: `DATA/files/RFL/Resource/RFLRes01.arc.lz` unpacks to 686,372-byte `RFL_Res.dat` (472 member models across 18 categories). Registered format identification in `wszst FILETYPE` (`RFL-RES`), verified `wszst EXTRACT` unpacks category members, and verified `wszst CREATE` roundtrips members byte-for-byte. Sliced fixture committed as `tests/fixtures/wii_retail/retail_rfl_beard.dat` |
| **RPAK** | `.rpak`, `.pak` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Retro Studios asset container (*Donkey Kong Country Returns*, Wii). Verified against a retail level pak (3672 entries); the original GameCube *Metroid Prime* (2002) uses an older, unrelated PAK layout without this format's STRG/RSHD header, so it doesn't apply here despite the similar extension |
| **RST / TOC** | `.rst`, `.toc` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Monster Games archive & table of contents (*Excite Truck* / *Excitebots*). Verified against the retail `race.res`/`race.toc` pair on both discs (the archive itself carries the `0TSR` magic; `.toc` is the paired index) -- cascades correctly into MOD/GLB, TEX/TM0/PNG, CAN and SFX exports |
| **SARC** | `.sarc`, `.szs` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | NintendoWare NW4F & NintendoSDK sorted archive (Wii U / Switch / 3DS). Verified against retail *Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival* (Wii U) WUX: `BfmaInfo.arc` (zlib-decompressed to 2,204 bytes, BE SARC) extracts `blyt/BfmaInfo.bflyt`, repacks via `wszst CREATE` to identical unpacked member bytes. Fixture: `tests/fixtures/wiiu_retail/retail_bfmainfo.sarc` |
| **SFZDAT** | `.dat` | ✅ | 🟡 | — | ✅ | *Star Fox Zero* (Wii U) flat archive (`DAT\0`). The bare `.dat` files live inside four CRIWARE `content/data00{0..3}.cpk` archives (see CPK row); once extracted, the existing `DAT\0` extractor cascades into them (`shader.dat` → 664 entries, `face/face_fox.dat` → `wtp`/`wta`). Verified against the retail WUX: 705 CPK members → ~11,675 files, zero skips |
| **CPK** | `.cpk` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | CRIWARE CPK archive (*Star Fox Zero*, Wii U): `CPK ` packet with a UTF header (TocOffset/ContentOffset/Files/Align; XOR-encrypted tables supported), `TOC ` packet with per-member DirName/FileName/FileSize/ExtractSize/FileOffset, CRILAYLA decompression. ITOC-only layouts declined (none on this corpus). `wszst xx` + `FILETYPE`; repack not implemented |
| **SIR0** | `.sir0` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Pokémon Mystery Dungeon resource container (DS / 3DS). Verified against the retail *PMD: Explorers of Sky* (USA) NDS ROM: 8685 files extracted from the `.nds` image; `data/BALANCE/item_s_p.bin` (3,856 bytes) is identified as SIR0 by `FILETYPE` and extracts to primary-data and subheader segments. Fixture committed as `tests/fixtures/ds_samples/sir0/pmd_eos_item_s_p.bin` |
| **STPK** | `.srd`, `.stpk` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | *Jump Super Stars* & *Jump Ultimate Stars* DS resource archive. Still no `STPK`-tagged file found anywhere in the retail *Jump Ultimate Stars* cart even after fixing ALAR extraction (see that row) and recovering ~3200 more files from it; either this cart doesn't use STPK at all, or it's nested deeper than this pass's recursion reached |
| **Storybook ONE** | `.one` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Sonic Team *Sonic and the Secret Rings* / *Black Knight* PRS-compressed container. The size-limit check used `out_size > opt_max_file_size` where 0 means "no limit" everywhere else in this codebase, so every real member (any nonzero size) was rejected unless `--max-file-size` happened to be set on the command line -- fixed and verified against a retail `.one` (33 members) |
| **TMPK** | `.pack`, `.tmpk` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | *The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD* archive (`TMPK`). Verified against the retail cart: `content/Shaders.pack.gz` (a plain gzip stream, unrelated to this project's own compression formats) unwraps to a 10,402,512-byte TMPK archive that extracts cleanly to exactly 1568 non-empty members via `wszst EXTRACT`. Committed gzipped as `tests/fixtures/tmpk_wiiu_twilight_princess_hd_shaders.pack.gz` |
| **VCRA** | `.bin`, `.vcra` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Bandai Namco Museum Remix archive format (Wii). Verified against the retail `resident.arc`: all 65 members extract and cascade correctly into nested BRRES/TPL/BRFNT decoding |
| **VIBS** | `.vibs` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Nintendo Switch Joy-Con vibration archive |
| **WARC** | `.warc` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Nintendo / Intelligent Systems flat archive (Wii U). Verified against the retail *Game & Wario* cart: `content/Puzzle/Bmp/Bmp.warc` (106,880 bytes) extracts cleanly to 93 non-empty `.bmp` members via `wszst EXTRACT`, and a second sample, `content/Common/Script.warc.fzip` (see FZIP below), decompresses to a 771,575-byte WARC payload that in turn extracts to 241 non-empty `.sttxt` members. Committed as `tests/fixtures/warc_wiiu_game_and_wario_bmp.warc` |
| **WTA / WTP** | `.wta` + `.wtp` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | PlatinumGames texture bundle (*Star Fox Zero*, Wii U big-endian `\0BTW` form): index + sibling payloads wrapped as `.gtx` for the normal GTX→PNG cascade (828 retail bundles → 2600 textures, 100% cascade). The older PC-style `WTA ` form keeps its own extractor |
| **WUD / WUX** | `.wud`, `.wux` | ✅ | — | — | — | Nintendo Wii U optical disc images (raw & compressed) |
| **XPCK** | `.xc`, `.xpck` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Level-5 container archive (*Inazuma Eleven*, *Professor Layton*, *Yo-kai Watch*). No standalone `.xc`/`.xpck` file exists in the retail *Yo-Kai Watch* cart -- every one is concatenated, back to back with no directory of its own, inside a single 386 MB `ARC0`-tagged flat archive (`yw1_a.fa`). Added a scanner that finds each XPCK by its own magic and measures its length from its own file table (`ARC0`'s own index wasn't reverse-engineered -- its two table sizes, 22360 and 28244, don't divide evenly into any byte range this pass could find); recovered 4087 real XPCK archives and 182,649 files (1.3 GB) from that one file, spot-checked with recognizable Level-5 tags (`ATRC01`, `XMPR`) surviving intact |
| **VFF** | `.vff` | ✅ | — | — | — | Nintendo VFF virtual FAT volume (PrFILE2 / eSOL), used by Wii channels and save data. A 0x20-byte big-endian wrapper over an ordinary little-endian FAT12/FAT16 image with the boot sector omitted, so a normal FAT tool cannot open one: two cluster-aligned FAT copies, a fixed 0x1000-byte root directory, then the clusters. Verified against volumes whose filesystems were built by mtools rather than by this project, subdirectories and multi-cluster files included |
| **ZDAT** | `.zdat` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp asset container (DeNA/Nintendo, mobile). Header, entry array, names, then payloads; each stored file is a Unity `UnityFS` bundle masked with a single repeated byte, recovered from the bundle's own signature rather than from any key. Verified against 31 containers taken from the game's CDN, 1 to 45 entries and 168 files: the entry table closes exactly on the file and every unmasked bundle agrees with the length it records for itself. Extraction stops at the bundle — nothing here reads Unity assets |
| **ZLARC** | `.zlarc` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | indieszero compressed package archive (*NES Remix*, *NES Remix 2*, *NES Remix Pack*). Verified against the retail *NES Remix Pack* (Wii U) -- 4 `.zlarc` files found (`content/Heri{1,2}/cmn/miiverse/HankoTga*.zlarc`, `content/Heri{1,2}/emu/vew/AllVewKey*.zlarc`), all plain zlib streams (`78 da`). The smallest, `HankoTga.zlarc` (37,882 bytes), decompresses cleanly to 4,968,395 bytes and is committed as `tests/fixtures/zlarc_wiiu_nes_remix_pack_hankotga.zlarc`. The decompressed payload is a flat offset/data blob, not a recognized container: `wszst FILETYPE` reports it as `U8`, but that's a false positive from the generic heuristic scorer -- the payload lacks `U8_MAGIC_NUM` (`55 AA 38 2D`) and `wszst EXTRACT` on it yields no members at all. So for this title "ZLARC" is just zlib-compressed data with no further sub-structure to decode |
| **ZTAB** | `.ztab`, `.tab` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Camelot archive table (*Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour*, *Mario Power Tennis*) |

`Byte-Exact Roundtrip` = build → extract → rebuild reproduces the archive's bytes
identically, so the writer's canonical layout is a fixed point of its own reader.
Exercised by `t_container_roundtrip()` in `tests/regress.sh`.

### 3D Models & Geometry

| Format | Extensions | Target Output | Decode Tested | Encode Tested | Byte-Exact Roundtrip | Retail Source Tested | Middleware / Engine / Platform Context |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **BCH** | `.bch` | **GLB** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | NintendoWare NW4C H3D binary character model (3DS) |
| **BCMDL / CGFX** | `.bcmdl`, `.cgfx` | **GLB** | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | NintendoWare NW4C CGFX 3D model resource (3DS) |
| **BCRES** | `.bcres` | **GLB** | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | NintendoWare NW4C CGFX 3D graphics and model resource container (3DS) |
| **BFRES** | `.bfres` | **GLB** | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Nintendo GX2 / NintendoSDK 3D model & surface resource archive (Wii U / Switch). Wii U geometry + FSKA skeletal clips export to GLB; Switch v8/v9/v10 geometry decodes via the version-gated BufferInfo pool (verified on Male.bfres: human-scale bboxes, index max = vcount-1). Skeletons follow BfresLibrary's FSKL/Bone layouts incl. v10 0x58-stride bones and quaternion rotations; skinning reads `_i0` indices (verified on 2284 Tomodachi Life v10 files: 2043/2043 geometries, 383 skins). All six Wii U animation entry bodies (FSKA/FSHU/FTXP/FVIS/FSHA/FSCN) structurally decode with per-curve validation (`wszst xx` prints an `ANIM:` summary line); entry layouts per the NintendoWare G3D SDK headers |
| **BMD** | `.bmd`, `.bdhc` | **GLB** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Early Nintendo DS 3D model format (DS) |
| **BNFM** | `.bnfm` | **GLB** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Nd Cube Wii U 3D model format (*Mario Party 10*, *Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival*). A prior pass here found every model on the amiibo Festival disc packed inside an undocumented `PAC\0` container and, after only trying a header-framed zlib/LZMA decompress, wrongly called the whole thing encrypted. A public QuickBMS script for this exact format (RandomTBush/RTB-QuickBMS-Scripts "MP10-Unpacker.bms") surfaced the real answer: every member is just ordinary zlib-compressed data (0x78 0xda header) -- verified directly against the retail disc's `content/common/bin/ch_base/chara/cat/cat00.bin` (20 members: sixteen real GX2 `Gfx2` textures, a `.mcf`, a `.gmo`, and `cat00.bnfm` itself), all decompressing via plain zlib inflate to exactly their header's declared size. See the new **PAC** row below for the container decoder this added (`ExtractPACArchive`, `file-type.c`'s `FF_PAC`) |
| **G1M** | `.g1m` | **GLB** | ✅ | — | — | ❌ | Koei Tecmo 3D model format (*Hyrule Warriors Legends*, 3DS; *Fire Emblem Warriors*). Positions, normals and UVs. Vertex colour is parsed but not exported; all 600 models checked carry a single bone and no blend attributes, so there is no skinning in this corpus to export. The Wii U original *Hyrule Warriors* was checked separately and ships zero bare `.g1m` files anywhere on the disc -- its model data is packed inside an undocumented, non-gzip chunked container (`*.bin.gz`/`*.g1t.gz`, real gzip magic `1f 8b` absent from all 5,720 samples) this project can't decode, so this attribution and its "Decode Tested" pass are 3DS-only |
| **G4PKM** | `.g4pkm` | — | — | — | — | — | Unidentified. Recognised by extension only, and the type table no longer claims a decoder or a cutter for it. The extension occurs in none of the games checked here, including a Level-5 3DS title (*Inazuma Eleven 3*, which uses `.pkh`/`.pkb`), and `pkm` in a Pokémon context names individual save data rather than a model, so the "3D model" this once claimed is unsupported |
| **GLG / RLG** | `.glg`, `.rlg` | **GLB** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Next Level Games 3D model format (*Super Mario Strikers*, *Mario Strikers Charged*) |
| **HSD** | `.dat` | **GLB** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | HAL Laboratory `sysdolphin` object graph (GameCube) |
| **HSF** | `.hsf` | **GLB** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Hudson Soft 3D model format (GameCube / Wii) |
| **LMD** | `.lmd` | — | — | — | — | — | Unidentified. Recognised by extension only, with no magic, decoder or cutter. `.lmd` is not a single format — several unrelated programs use it — and no sample backs the *Pokémon Masters* attribution once claimed here |
| **MDL0 / BRRES** | `.mdl0`, `.brres` | **GLB** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | NintendoWare NW4R binary resource model (Wii). Encoding injects into a parent, and anything that did not change is preserved from that parent byte for byte -- an MDL0 quantizes each vertex array to its own type and divisor, shares arrays between objects and draws them from a display list, none of which a GLB can carry, so only what actually changed is rebuilt. Textures travel inside the GLB and are written back on repack: an edited one is re-encoded in the parent's own format, indexed textures keeping their C4/C8 pixels and their sibling PLT0 palette |
| **MOD** | `.mod` | **GLB** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Monster Games NDL3/NDL2 display list model (Wii) |
| **MSH (PMsh)** | `.msh` | **GLB** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Monster Games collision mesh format (Wii) |
| **NSBMD** | `.nsbmd`, `.bmd` | **GLB** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Nintendo DS Nitro 3D model format (DS). Verified against the retail *Animal Crossing: Wild World* (USA) NDS ROM: `data/insect/51/bug53.nsbmd` (1,524 bytes, 1 mesh, 4 nodes) exports to a valid GLB model. Committed as `tests/fixtures/nitro_samples/retail_bug53.nsbmd` |
| **NUD** | `.nud` | **GLB** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Bandai Namco 3D model format (*Super Smash Bros. 4* Wii U / 3DS) |
| **NUMSHB** | `.numshb` | **GLB** | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Bandai Namco SSBH 3D mesh model (*Super Smash Bros. Ultimate* Switch). MESH v1.10: positions, normals, UVs, and skinning when the sibling `.nusktb` skeleton is present. v1.8 shares those field offsets but its attribute array points elsewhere, so positions are recovered from the vertex buffer and kept only when they fall inside the object's own bounding box, giving geometry without normals or UVs; tangents and colour sets are parsed but not exported |
| **MPR CMDL** | `.cmdl` | **GLB** | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Retro Studios static model (*Metroid Prime Remastered*, Switch): LE RFRM form (`CMDL` v114/125) with HEAD/MTRL/MESH/VBUF/IBUF/GPU chunks plus a trailing FOOT/META buffer table (LZSS mode 0-3 GPU buffers, same dispatch as MPR PACK). Verified against all 687 retail CMDL members (every one yields a valid glTF, incl. a 51-mesh 2.2 MB scene); meshes carry positions + normals/UVs/colours where the vertex components provide them, positions required finite and inside the HEAD AABB. The skinned SMDL form (v127/133, SKHD chunk) decodes unskinned through the same path (179/179 valid). Its skinning data is parsed and validated, not trusted: SKHD word 1 is the bone count (every `BoneIndices` u8x4 value is below it across all 179 files; `BoneWeights` are half-x4 or float-x4 rows summing to ~1), and meshes failing either check are skipped. MTRL material names are exported and bound per-mesh (2167 across the corpus); diffuse (`DIFT`) texture uuids resolve to embedded PNGs through the deferred tree-wide image index whenever the referenced `<uuid>.TXTR.png` was extracted beside the model (PACK cascade), else they stay external URIs. Skinned SMDL joint/weight export is phase 3 (bone transforms live outside the files and no skeleton oracle exists yet) |
| **PERS** | `.pers` | *(raw payload)* | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Pokémon Stadium (N64) PERS-SZP container: a 24-byte header around a Yay0 stream. Verified against all 410 instances in the retail cart. The payload is not yet parsed, and the sibling `FRAGMENT` signature is a MIPS code overlay, not a model |
| **WMB** | `.wmb` | **GLB** | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | PlatinumGames model (*Star Fox Zero*, Wii U big-endian `\0BMW`): all 7 retail vertex layouts, 10-10-10 normals, strips→triangles with corrected winding (faces agree with normals 1618/1618 on Fox McCloud). Verified: 627 files → 2903 meshes, all valid glTF. Skeletal export from the bone parent/position tables (490 files skinned, 3707 joints, unit weight sums); untextured |

`Byte-Exact Roundtrip` = decode → GLB → re-encode reproduces the original file's bytes identically (canonical fixed-point verified), not just a successful encode.

### Textures & 2D Graphics

| Format | Extensions | Decode Tested | Encode Tested | Byte-Exact Roundtrip | Retail Source Tested | Middleware / Engine / Platform Context |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AJPG / ODH** | `.ajpg` | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | ActImagine baseline-JPEG-derived still image format (GBA / Wii Message Board) |
| **ART / IMG** | `.art`, `.img` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Monster Games GUI image format (Wii) |
| **BCFNT / BFFNT / BRFNT** | `.bcfnt`, `.bffnt`, `.brfnt` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | NintendoWare font resource (3DS / Wii U / Wii) |
| **BCLIM** | `.bclim` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | NintendoWare NW4C texture container (3DS) |
| **BFLIM** | `.bflim` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | NintendoWare NW4F texture format (Wii U) |
| **BNR** | `.bnr` | ✅ | — | — | — | Nintendo GameCube & Wii game opening banner icon (RGB5A3) |
| **BNTX** | `.bntx` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | NintendoSDK Tegra block-linear texture container (Switch) |
| **BREFT** | `.breft`, `.bt-img` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | NintendoWare NW4R particle effect texture (Wii) |
| **BTI / TPL** | `.bti`, `.tpl` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Nintendo standard texture palette library (GameCube / Wii) |
| **Camelot GX bank** | *(none)*, `.stpl`, `.sbn` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Camelot GX texture bank, standalone or inline in a model module (*Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour*, *Mario Power Tennis* GC & Wii, *We Love Golf!*) |
| **CTPK** | `.ctpk` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | NintendoWare NW4C texture package (3DS) |
| **CTXB** | `.ctxb` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Grezzo 3DS texture container (*Ocarina of Time 3D*, *Majora's Mask 3D*). A standalone `.ctxb` -- the common case, since these ship loose in `romfs/` rather than inside a GAR/ZAR -- never reached the decoder at all before this pass (wrong dispatch entirely, not a decode bug); fixed and verified against the retail romfs (1666 files). The decoder walks every texture entry in each `tex ` chunk, not just entry 0 (real romfs files pack several per chunk and entry 0 is not always decodable). Note: the decoder itself still only recovers the first texture of the first `tex ` chunk, and a GAR/ZAR's own extraction doesn't self-cascade into its output the way ABE/BNS/RST/RPAK do, so an embedded `.ctxb` only decodes on a second pass over that output directory |
| **DSB / TXTR** | `.bin` | 🟡 | — | — | — | Animal Crossing: Wild World DS menu texture (RGB555 + A3I5). No standalone file carrying the `TXTR` magic turned up anywhere across the retail cart's ~18,100 extracted files, so this pass couldn't confirm it against real data; it may only ever appear embedded in ARM9/overlay code rather than as its own file |
| **Retro TXTR** | `.txtr` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Retro Studios texture, old revision (*Metroid Prime 1-3*, *Donkey Kong Country Returns*, Wii): BE header (GX format 0-0xA, dimensions, mip count), optional palette header, GX-tiled mip chain. Non-indexed formats decode via the shared GX tile codec and re-encode byte-exact (single mip); C4/C8 indexed decode via the sibling palette, C14X2 is rejected. Verified against retail *Donkey Kong Country Returns* (Wii) WBFS disc: 55 retail `.txtr` textures extracted from `MiscData.pak`, decoding 16x16 CMPR cleanly to PNG. Fixture: `tests/fixtures/wii_retail/retail_0005_16x16.txtr` (140 bytes) |
| **Tropical TXTR** | `.txtr` | ✅ | — | — | — | Retro Studios texture, new revision (*Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze*, Wii U): RFRM form (`TXTR` id) with HEAD parameters and LZSS-compressed (modes 0-3, zlib fallback) GX2 surface data. Decodes 2D depth-1 surfaces via the GX2 detiler (base mip); cubemaps/arrays and Tropical re-encode are not implemented. `wimgt DECODE` + `wszst xx` |
| **MPR TXTR** | `.txtr` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Retro Studios texture, Remastered revision (*Metroid Prime Remastered*, Switch): LE RFRM form (`TXTR` v47/51) + HEAD + GPU buffers assembled from the FOOT META table, detiled with the Tegra block-linear path and pixel-decoded incl. BC1-7/ASTC. Verified against the retail `MiscData.pak` TXTR (232x232 R8Unorm) plus real ASTC/BC7 game textures. `wimgt DECODE` + `wszst xx` (PACK extract leaves a cascade `.TXTR.png`). An `RFRM` form nothing in the family claims reports UNKNOWN rather than falling through to the LZ10/LZ11 single-byte guesses (real TXTRs used to misreport as LZ streams, aborting image decode) |
| **G1T** | `.g1t` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Koei Tecmo texture container (*Hyrule Warriors Legends*, 3DS; *Fire Emblem Warriors*). 3DS ETC1/ETC1A4/RGBA8 — 2602 of the 2603 textures on the *Hyrule Warriors Legends* cart; the one holdout uses an 8bpp encoding no other file exercises. Wii U side, verified against the retail *Hyrule Warriors* WUX: 3 unwrapped big-endian `G1TG` files extract (same walk, byte-swapped fields), and the 3857 `.g1t.gz` members decode through a chunked wrapper (BE u32 magic `0x10000` + count + size + table, size-prefixed zlib streams, zero padding, trailing sparse block) — 3857/3857 yield containers, with 3DS-format members inside Wii U files decoding to real pixels (2048×1024 company logo verified); the wrapper no longer misroutes to 7z. Wii U GX2 member pixel formats (`0x60`/`0x62`) export raw for now. See PLAN.md #16 |
| **GTX** | `.gtx` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Nintendo Wii U GX2 surface container (Wii U) |
| **GVR** | `.gvr` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Sega GameCube & Wii texture container (GCIX / GVRT). Verified against the retail *Sonic and the Secret Rings* (Wii) WBFS disc: `st_02_p_light.gvr` (160 bytes, 16x16 CMPR) and `efct_r_fire_kona01.gvr` (64x64 IA4) decode cleanly to PNG. Fixture committed as `tests/fixtures/wii_retail/retail_st_02_p_light.gvr` |
| **NDS banner** | `banner.bin` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Nintendo DS ROM banner: 32x32 icon (plus DSi animated icon frames) and per-language titles (DS / DSi). Verified against retail *Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky* (USA) NDS ROM: `banner.bin` (2,560 bytes) is identified as NDS-BANNER and decodes cleanly to a 32x32 RGB PNG. Fixture: `tests/fixtures/ds_samples/banner/retail_pmd_eos_banner.bin` |
| **Wii banner** | `opening.bnr`, `IMET`, `IMD5` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Wii channel/disc banner: IMET header (per-language titles, MD5 verified) plus the inner U8 whose IMD5 (and optional `LZ77`) wrapped members expand to BRLYT/BRLAN/TPL/BNS |
| **WIBN** | `banner.bin`, `.bnr` | ✅ | — | — | — | Wii *save game* banner: a 192x64 RGB5A3 banner image plus up to 8 48x48 icon animation frames, with the title/subtitle pair; the frame count follows from the file size, and trailing all-zero frames are padding |
| **NCER / NANR** | `.ncer`, `.nanr` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Nintendo DS Nitro cell & animation resources (DS) |
| **NCGR / NCLR** | `.ncgr`, `.nclr` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Nintendo DS Nitro 2D graphics & palette (DS) |
| **NSCR** | `.nscr` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Nintendo DS Nitro screen/tilemap resource, rendered against its NCGR tiles and NCLR palette (DS) |
| **NSBCA / NSBTA / NSBTP / NSBVA / NSBMA** | `.nsbca`, `.nsbta`, `.nsbtp`, `.nsbva`, `.nsbma` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Nintendo DS Nitro animation family (joint, texture SRT, texture pattern, visibility, material colour). NSBCA joints decode to a GLB animation when the sibling NSBMD is exported, keyframes verified against the Nitro SDK animation engine; encoding a bare NSBCA is a byte-exact pass-through, and a GLB animation re-encode rebuilds a fresh SDK-conformant NSBCA (pivot/ROT5 FX12 fixed-point) whose decode round-trips frame-for-frame; the other four are validated structurally and passed through unchanged |
| **NSBTX** | `.nsbtx` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Nintendo DS Nitro 3D texture container (DS) |
| **NUT** | `.nut` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Bandai Namco texture package (*Super Smash Bros. 4* Wii U / 3DS). Verified against the retail Wii U disc: an `NTP3` texture carved out of `content/dt00` (addressed via `content/ls`, zlib-inflated) decodes to a real DDS (`tests/fixtures/nut_wiiu_smash4_texture.nut`) |
| **NUTEXB** | `.nutexb` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | Bandai Namco / Nintendo Switch texture wrapper (Switch) |
| **PTLG** | `.glt`, `.rlt` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Next Level Games texture container, extracted as TPL (*Super Mario Strikers*, *Mario Strikers Charged*). Verified against retail *Mario Strikers Charged* (Wii) WBFS disc: `characterballoon.rlt` (2,784 bytes) extracts `8ffc5fbe.tpl` and decodes to 64x64 CMPR PNG. Fixture: `tests/fixtures/wii_retail/retail_characterballoon.rlt` |
| **SMDH** | `.smdh` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Nintendo 3DS application icon, publisher info & title metadata |
| **TEX** | `.tex` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Monster Games GX texture format (Wii) |
| **TM0** | `.tm0` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Monster Games high-resolution texture (*Excite Truck*, Wii): an explicit header at 0x80 followed by a CMPR colour mip chain and, for renderer code 0x44, an I4 stencil chain that supplies the alpha. Both chains are 4bpp over 8x8 tiles and so identical in length, and nothing in the header names them apart. ExciteBots ships a headerless variant of the same container, which is not decoded yet |
| **CAN** | `.can` | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | Monster Games skeletal animation (*Excite Truck* / *ExciteBots*, Wii), converted to a GLB with the node hierarchy and one rotation/translation/scale channel per node. No magic: a little-endian header, 0x64-byte node records with a column-major rest matrix, and 36-byte keys of quaternion + translation + uniform scale + time. Verified across all 973 nodes of the 29 non-empty retail animations: hierarchy, rest pose, key values and duration all reproduced |
| **TEX0** | `.tex0` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | NintendoWare NW4R texture resource (Wii) |
| **TEX3DS** | `.tex` | — | — | — | — | Nintendo 3DS proprietary texture (identification only) |
| **XIMG** | `.xi` | — | — | — | — | Level-5 3DS/Switch image & texture container |

`Byte-Exact Roundtrip` = encode → decode → re-encode to the same destination name
reproduces the file's bytes. Exercised by `t_byte_fixed_points()` in `tests/regress.sh`.
BRRES sub-file formats (TEX0, TEX) embed their own name, so the name has to match.

### Audio, Sound & Music

| Format | Extensions | Decode Tested | Encode Tested | Retail Source Tested | Middleware / Engine / Platform Context |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **BARS** | `.bars` | ✅ | — | — | Nintendo Binary Audio Resource Archive (Wii U / Switch) |
| **BCSAR / BCWAR / BCWAV** | `.bcsar`, `.bcwar`, `.bcwav` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | NintendoWare NW4C sound archive & wave format (3DS). Verified: `GreenCube.bcsar` (Luigi's Mansion 3DS, 16 MB) and `QueenSound.bcsar` (OoT3D, 7 MB) each unpack full archives — 169 files from QueenSound, cascading to `.bcseq`/`.bcwar`/`.bcwav`/`.bcgrp` with WAV decode of every BCWAV. BCSTM verified against *Yo-Kai Watch* retail RomFS: `ev01_0020_01.dspadpcm.bcstm` (5,728 bytes) decodes to WAV via the bfstm demuxer (adpcm_thp_le). Fixture: `tests/fixtures/3ds_samples/yokai_bcstm/ev01_0020_01.dspadpcm.bcstm` |
| **BFSAR / BFWAR / BFWAV** | `.bfsar`, `.bfwar`, `.bfwav` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | NintendoWare NW4F & NintendoSDK sound archive & wave format (Wii U / Switch). SYMB-less archives unpack too: `wbfsar extract` carves every FILE-pool asset via the FileInfo image reference (verified on YWW pj023.bfsar: 821 assets incl. 811 FSEQ). Sound->File names use the verified 12-byte STRG records |
| **BRSAR / RBNK / RWAV** | `.brsar`, `.rbnk`, `.rwav` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | NintendoWare NW4R sound archive, instrument bank & wave format (Wii) |
| **BRSTM / BCSTM / BFSTM** | `.brstm`, `.bcstm`, `.bfstm` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Nintendo multi-channel stream audio (Wii / 3DS / Wii U / Switch) |
| **NUS3AUDIO** | `.nus3audio`, `.nus3bank` | ✅ | ✅ | — | Bandai Namco NUS3 audio archive (*Super Smash Bros. Ultimate* Switch). Note: *Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS* retail `.nus3bank` files use a `BANKTOC ` (8-byte) chunk tag instead of the Switch/Wii U `AUDIINDX` tag; the current decoder doesn't recognise `BANKTOC` and returns `ERR_INVALID_DATA` — the 3DS NUS3 variant is **not supported** |
| **RSEQ / CSEQ / FSEQ / SSEQ** | `.rseq`, `.cseq`, `.fseq`, `.sseq` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Nintendo sequence music format (Wii / 3DS / Wii U / DS). Disassembler handles the full MML set incl. extended (F0) commands, IF/TIME/RANDOM/VARIABLE prefixes and real LABEL names; FSEQ uses the true block-table container. Verified: 811/811 retail Wii U sequences round-trip byte-exact. Wii RSEQ verified too (direct-offset container, compact labels, code-exact round-trips) |
| **SADL** | `.sad`, `.sadl` | ✅ | — | ✅ | Level-5 / *Professor Layton* audio stream container (DS) |
| **SDAT** | `.sdat` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Nintendo DS Nitro sound archive (DS) |

### Passthrough & External Tool Delegation

When extracting or repacking game trees with `wszst xx` / `wszst create`, unsupported container formats, optical disc images, and proprietary media are transparently delegated to external tools (configurable via `--with-<tool>=...` or `--no-passthrough`):

| Category / Format | Extensions & Types | Delegated Tool | Description & Integration |
|---|---|---|---|
| **7-Zip / RAR / Tar / Gzip Archives** | `.7z`, `.rar`, `.cb7`, `.tar`, `.tgz`, `.tbz2`, `.txz`, `.gz` | **`7z`** / **`7zz`** / **`7za`** / **`unar`** (`--with-7z`) | General archive unpacking, including a lone gzip-wrapped file (e.g. a Wii U retail asset shipped as `name.pack.gz`) |
| **Custom Binary Containers** | Arbitrary formats | **`QuickBMS`** (`--bms=<script.bms>`) | Direct execution of QuickBMS extraction scripts |
| **DSP-ADPCM Audio Streams** | `.brstm`, `.bcstm`, `.bfstm`, `.bns`, `.btsnd`, `.ast`, `.dsp` | **`mobipeg`** | Bit-exact Nintendo THP ADPCM coefficient search & stream encoding |
| **Mobiclip Video & Cutscenes** | `.mo`, `.mods`, `.moflex`, `.MOC`, `.MOD` | **`mobipeg`** (`--with-mobipeg`) / **`ffmpeg`** | Nintendo DS / 3DS / Wii Mobiclip video decoding to MP4 |
| **Nintendo 3DS Containers** | `.3ds`, `.cci`, `.cxi`, `.cfa`, `.cia`, `.app` | **`ctrtool`** / **`makerom`** (`--with-ctrtool`) | NCCH/NCSD partition extraction, ExeFS/RomFS unpacking & CIA installation packages |
| **Nintendo DS / DSi ROMs** | `.nds`, `.srl`, `.dsi` | **`ndstool`** (`--with-ndstool`) | Nitro ROM header, banner, arm9/arm7 binary & NitroFS extraction/rebuild |
| **Nintendo Switch Packages** | `.nsp`, `.xci`, `.nca` | **`hactool`** / **`hacbrewpack`** (`--with-hactool`, `--with-hacbrewpack`) | PFS0 / HFS0 / NCA content extraction & homebrew NSP repacking |
| **THP & Media Video** | `.thp`, `.h4m`, `.vid`, `.dpg`, `.fv`, `.ppm`, `.kwz`, `.mmstr`, `.rvid`, `.vx` | **`mobipeg`** / **`ffmpeg`** | GameCube/Wii THP, HVQM4, DPG, FastVideo & Flipnote animation decoding. Factor 5 VID1 DivX (`.vid`, GameCube): `VID1`-magic files decode to a `.mp4` preview via an external VID1 decoder (`VID1DEC=/path/to/binary`, else `NeversoftMultitool` on PATH) — stock ffmpeg/mobipeg cannot read the proprietary VIDD macroblock stream (verified against retail *Carmen Sandiego* discs: a standards-conformant remux opens but decodes to noise); without the decoder they are skipped, and there is deliberately no native demuxer. Bare-`.vid` files with no VID1 magic still go to the media tools |
| **SFX** | `.sfx` | **`mobipeg`** / **`ffmpeg`** | Monster Games DSP-ADPCM audio (*Excite Truck*, *ExciteBots*, Wii). A 0x80 header over a plain Nintendo DSP-ADPCM stream: sizes and sample rate little-endian, nibble count and coefficients in the usual big-endian DSP form. No magic, so a file identifies itself by its payload size accounting for the rest of the file and a byte rate twice the sample rate. Wrapped in GENH and decoded through the audio pass-through rather than re-implementing adpcm_thp; verified bit-identical to that decoder across all 145 effects on the disc |
| **Wii / GameCube Disc Images** | `.iso`, `.wbfs`, `.wdf`, `.ciso`, `.wia` | **`wit`** (`--with-wit`) | Disc partition extraction & scrubbed disc creation |
| **Wii U Optical Discs** | `.wud`, `.wux` | **`wud2app`** + **`cdecrypt`** | Automated compressed WUX disc decompression, partition dump & decryption |
| **Wii WAD Packages** | `.wad`, `.app` | **`sharpii`** (`--with-sharpii`) | Wii title & IOS WAD archive unpacking and repacking |
