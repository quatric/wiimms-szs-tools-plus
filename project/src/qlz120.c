// QuickLZ 1.20 compiled as a namespaced translation unit.
//
// The vendor drop (wqlz_comp_120.c) is a complete program: it exports the
// codec AND a main(). Both QuickLZ versions export the same symbol names, so
// linking the two together needs one of them renamed. Renaming here rather
// than editing the vendor file keeps that file byte-identical to upstream and
// makes future re-drops a straight copy.
//
// Every non-static symbol the vendor file exports is listed below; the set was
// taken from nm(1) on the compiled object, not guessed.
